# Making of My Portfolio


## Clean, Intuitive Navigation
I really left a lot of this up to the Docusaurus framework as I find it to handle navigation well.
I think the headers & footers are simple & effective, and I made sure that all the links had
more accurate labels and were up-to-date. I also included buttons to the most important pages
directly on the homepage.

## Intentional Color Choices
I wanted to use purple for my portfolio as it's my favorite color, and I feel that it's a good
choice to stand out without being as excessive or bold as something like orange or red. I wrote
a lot more about choosing this color in <a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.
Additionally, I was very intentional in the shades of purple I used for both light and dark mode
to ensure the best contrast with the primary text colors (best seen in the homepage banner). The
deeper purple works better with white text while the more pale purple works better with black.

## Harmony Between Affordances and Signifiers
The homepage has a few good examples of affordances & signifiers. For example, the two buttons
in the banner are large and stand out from the banner to indicate their importance. These
lead to the two primary pages of the portfolio besides the one you're currently on, so
there is harmony here. On the project page, there is also a carousel which shows my
original mockups. The arrows and "you are here" dots on the carousel light up and
become dull in accordance to which direction you can move or which mockup you are
viewing in the order.

## Some Consideration to Accessibility
On all images used in blogs and throughout the portfolio, I have included alt tags which
give a description of the image. These descriptions have gotten better/more descriptive
further into the project as I started to better understand the significance of good
descriptions for screen readers.

## Usability Elements to Help Make Content Easier to Digest
I will again point to the carousel implemented on the project page for original mockups.
This conserves space and is much sleeker than including several different images in a
row on that page. Using what's already available in Docusaurus and Markdown, I've
also been able to include solid headers and bulleted lists such as in
<a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/uiun" target="_blank">this blog post.</a>

## Evidence of Evolution
If you look at <a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/portfolios" target="_blank">this earlier blog post</a>, you
can hover over the image to see that the alt text is relatively simple and doesn't have
the best description of the image. Compare this to 
<a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/uiun" target="_blank">a more recent blog post</a>
that came after the lessons on accessibility, and you will see that the descriptions got much
longer and more accurate rather than simply "\<topic\> stock image."

## Proper Attribution of Others' Work
All blog posts relating to a textbook or reading contain a note at the top of the post
denoting that it is a reflection of someone else's work. The work is also cited in a
footnote at the bottom of the page with in-text links at least in the note at the top
which references the work.

## Intentional Integration of Your Values
One decision I made in the values of simplicity and efficiency was to move the "About Me"
section directly onto the homepage. I feel that this combines the homepage that would've
been low on content with a more productive page. This is also what I view as the main
thing someone is looking for when they first hit a portfolio, so I think it makes
sense to put it front and center.
