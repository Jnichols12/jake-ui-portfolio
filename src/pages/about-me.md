# About Me

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}} width="100%">

	![Alt text](/img/jake_profile.jpg "An image of my face")

	My name is Jake Nichols, and I'm a full-stack software developer living in Lincoln, NE. I primarily work on MVC projects in
	the .NET Framework, and I focus on web development. Design has been a bit of a blind spot for me, so this portfolio follows my
	introduction into the field. You can find my <a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/projects/mobile-order">first UI project</a> and a
	<a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog">blog</a> with reflections on design literature and activities.
