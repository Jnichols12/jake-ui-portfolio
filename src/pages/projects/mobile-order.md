# Mobile Order App

<p>As someone who often orders on the go between classes, I find that simplicity is the most important quality in
a mobile-ordering app. As such, my goal is to redesign my university's dining app to unite users with their 
next meal as fast as possible. The app will be lightweight and easy to navigate so that no time should be wasted fumbling 
through menus while hunger is at stake.</p>
