## Conclusion

<p>
	Though I've ended this project in a less polished state than I would have liked to, I'm still
	grateful for the lessons I've learned. I've identified that while I'm happy with my ability to
	identify problems, brainstorm solutions, and design general layouts, I still struggle
	with the fine arts and prototyping aspects of design. I can picture a great design in my head,
	but I struggle to put it to paper (metaphorically) in a way that is satisfying to my goals.
	I will also be able to approach any future projects with the knowledge that users expect 
	prototypes to be less abstract than I initially viewed them, and I should have a plan for 
	anything that I decide to use as a placeholder or to fill space.
	I hope to continue to iterate on these weaknesses through future projects in an attempt to 
	round out my skills as a designer and a developer.
