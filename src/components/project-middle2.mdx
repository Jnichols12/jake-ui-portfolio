<p style={{marginTop: "2rem"}}>
	The first iteration of the prototype was quite rough as I was really struggling to get my
	bearings in Figma, and I couldn't figure out how to make my app properly fit a device frame.
	Part of this was down to the dimensions of my app, but it also depended on a silly decision
	I made by showing tiles leading off the page in an attempt to indicate that they were
	scrollable. Though this made sense in my head at the time, the only way I could think to do
	this was to cover the cut off portions with a black box. I didn't learn until later that
	there are techniques to make something properly scrollable in Figma, and by that point,
	I scrapped the idea and moved away from scrolling entirely. Once I figured out the 
	issue with my dimensions being too short, it already felt too late in the project to
	fully redesign multiple pages or extend the content to fit the dimensions of a real
	phone, so I unframed the prototype and continued on, which you will see in the final
	prototype.

## User Testing & Iteration

<p>
	Upon completing the early prototype, I began user testing with colleagues of mine also
	interested in design as well as possible end-users. These were all college students who had at least some familiarity
	with the current mobile-ordering app, but not all of them use or have used the app personally.
	Testers were read a script which outlined the parameters of the test such as how the data
	would be used and who would have access to it (which was basically just me). I then asked
	the testers to attempt to place an order through the app while speaking their thought
	process out loud as well as anything that stood out to them as a strength or
	weakness of the design. I did my best not to guide them through this workflow at all, and
	everyone seemed go through it nearly flawlessly.
	I admittedly did not gain as much feedback during these sessions as I would have liked.
	I was given generally positive feedback about the layout and overall simplicity of the app
	which is a positive as that was a core value from the start, but I was hoping for more issues
	to be pointed out besides the prototype not fitting the frame and other things of that nature.
	Ultimately, I feel I learned the most by reflecting on how people attempted to interact with the
	app rather than what they told me.
</p>

<p>
	For example, every user who tested the prototype tried to click the order confirmation button before
	filling out credit card info. In some sense, this was a kayak problem that everyone
	recovered from shortly after. However, fixing the confirm button was a trivial point to avoid
	something that every user who tested the app was running into. At the time, the button was still
	green, but it was translucent in an attempt to communicate that it couldn't be used yet. After
	bringing it up to one of my colleagues that every user had done that so far, he suggested that
	I make the button gray rather than translucent. I took this feedback and implemented this small
	change. Though I would still see some users immediately click the button only to realize that
	they must first set up the payment info, it decreased the number of users who thought this was
	a clickable button overall.
</p>

<p>
	As it was an elephant in the room, I then chose to address the poor framing and centering of
	the prototype. As mentioned above, I never fully fixed this problem as even the current prototype
	is not long enough to fit a real mobile device frame. However, the original implementation was
	so glaringly bad that I had to scrap it by ceasing to pretend that restaurants and items would
	be scrollable. I then removed the frame as I figured having no frame was better than it being
	poorly framed. This is still how it's done in the final prototype unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
	I also realized during testing that I didn't do anything to alleviate one of my core issues with the
	real app. My prototype just listed the item options (e.g. toppings) as text that
	couldn't be selected individually to edit one without worrying about the rest. In the current app, you
	must go through context menus for every option/topping on the item to edit a single option and add it
	back to your cart. Since this is something I aimed to fix from the start, I wanted to go back and 
	separate the options into their own links which take you back to the customization page. In doing so, 
	I created distinct links for each option that could be clicked in the final prototype. However, I
	did not implement more than one topping to the item page, so the effect of this was somewhat lost,
	and it became another abstract representation that didn't translate well to the prototype. Additionally,
	these links are still quite small and close together which is something I would address given future
	iteration.
</p>

<p>
	Another thing I noticed during testing was that I did not like the look of the thicker divider
	which separates major page elements (such as the favorites from restaurant/item groups). It did
	not have the negative space effect I intended for it to have. This stood out to me as just a block of
	gray on the page which looked poor. I found the sizing to be okay, so I wasn't fully sure why it didn't 
	give the effect I wanted. After looking at other apps for inspiration, I realized that the main issue
	was that it didn't fit the color scheme of the app. I was using gray to attempt to portray negative
	space in an app that used all off-white backgrounds. By changing the color of the divider to something
	derived from the off-white background but more pale and subdued, I was able to better achieve the
	negative space feeling I was looking for. I'm quite happy with how this turned out in the final
	prototype, and I wouldn't adjust it further.
</p>

<p>
	For a final example of a change I made from user testing, I decided to shrink some of the headers
	as previously mentioned. This was in part due to feedback from one colleague of mine, but I also
	had my own feelings that they were too large in some areas and didn't allow for as many other
	elements on the page as there should've been. However, most testers actually commented that they
	liked how large the text was and that if I were to decrease it, I should be very careful with
	doing so. I only decreased the font by a few points, and I think the app is better off for it.
	It made room for more elements on the page, but it still retained the large and easy-to-read
	aspects that many testers enjoyed.
</p>

## Final Design System and Prototype

<p>
	With the iteration from user testing done, I was able to put the finishing touches on my
	design system. While there is still a lot more to be done to make this a polished design for
	a production application, I'm happy with the progress I've made as a designer through this
	project, and I've chosen to stop here. It feels like I've accrued too much tech debt
	to get the prototype to its current state, and I would rather start from scratch than
	continue to work on top of the mistakes I made from the start (especially with my initial poor
	understanding of Figma components). Ultimately, I feel that it still captures the simplicity
	that I aimed for from the beginning, and I'm glad to have been able to maintain a better
	focus on health than the current application by including a space for caloric information
	as well as full nutrition details if provided. Below, you can view the final design
	system:
