	With these sketches as a basis, I began to list out all the components necessary to build an early
	design system which would allow me to make proper mockups. In building this system, I decided to keep
	it light on colors as this would essentially be the white label version of the app which universities
	could customize to their own color scheme, logo, and other differentiating elements. In hindsight, I
	wish I had done more research into what was necessary to use my university's branding as the white label
	aspects seemed to confuse a lot of users in my testing (which will be discussed more later). I learned that 
	people were expecting more of a finished product that they would see on campus while I was approaching
	the mockups and subsequent prototype as more of an abstract representation of the app. Regardless,
	this was the decision I made at the time, and I stuck with it to the end for good or ill.

	Additionally, I chose to give the app a bottom navbar similar to what you would see on an Android phone
	as one of my initial interviewees complained about the lack of back buttons in the current app. Again,
	hindsight is 20/20 here, and if I were to go back, I would include only a contextual, floating back button
	and allow the app's icon to be the home button. The "more" tab was another feature I put in as a placeholder,
	but this attracted a lot more attention than I intended it to. I never had solid plans for what to put in that
	menu, so I would remove it entirely if I were to start from scratch or do a proper overhaul.

	Another choice I made in my design system was to keep the fonts quite large. At a certain point, I thought
	some of the headers came out a bit excessive, and I did eventually shrink them slightly for more real estate
	for other features. However, the large font ended up being one of the things I got continuous positive
	feedback about. Users really loved it, and I think I'll continue to stick to large fonts in future
	designs where possible.

	Having made these core design decisions, I began work on the original mockups which I would iterate on until 
	the final prototype. You can view these early mockups below as well as the first Figma prototype of the app:
