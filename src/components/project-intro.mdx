# Mobile-Ordering App

<br />

## Introduction & Motivation
<p>
    As someone who often orders on the go between classes, I find that simplicity is the most important quality in
    a mobile-ordering app. At times, I find the current solution at my university at odds with this value, and there
    are things I would like to see changed about it. This is a sentiment I've also had shared with me by other students,
    especially in relation to this project. Getting solid nutrition into your daily routine despite the busy schedules of 
    college students shouldn't require jumping through hoops. A mobile-ordering apps whould improve the user's life by
    conveniently and simply providing a way to make sure a meal is ready when you are. As such, my goal is to redesign my 
    university's dining app to unite users with their next meal as fast as possible.

    As implied by the word "mobile," this app is designed specifically around phones. While a desktop version of the
    app would also be helpful to students looking to order during the tail-end of a class, it was not the focus for
    the scope of this project. I think a desktop app or website would be worth looking into if this app was fully implemented though.
    Regardless, mobile is the main concern here as this app is as much about simplicity as it as ordering on the go. Users
    need to be able to set up their next meal while transitioning between classes, activities, work, and any other obligations.

    The design was made to be lightweight and easy to navigate so that no time should be wasted fumbling
    through menus while hunger is at stake. Additionally, I think that everyone deserves to have the information necessary
    to make informed decisions about the food they put in their body. At a bare minimum, caloric information should be
    provided on all foods you order so that you can take it into consideration if you choose to.

    Throughout this project, I've worked as the sole designer and developer. In general, I haven't worked on all that many
    software projects solo or as a lead, so this was a relatively new experience for me. The entire creative process was
    my own, and I had to learn more about building something from nothing. A lot of the lessons in this project for me
    came from learning how to brainstorm smarter and how to iterate on strong initial concepts through user testing and
    reflection to create something presentable.

## Early Design Process
<p>
    Once I knew I wanted to redesign the mobile-ordering app, I began with further identifying the target audience. After
    interviewing two of my close friends and discovering their motiviations for placing mobile orders as well as their pain points
    with the current implementation, I drafted the following user story:
    
</p>

<div style={{display: "flex", width: "100%", justifyContent: "center"}}>
    <p style={{width: "75%", textAlign: "center"}}>
        Alex is a Junior business administration major at UNL with very little tech background outside of using a smartphone and little patience.
        On one Monday morning, nothing seemed to be going right. He woke up late after sleeping through multiple alarms. He flew out the door without
        a shower after waking up and seeing on his phone that he only has 15 minutes until his first class. Despite flooring his car down every street he could,
        he hit every light red and arrived to his first sequence of classes late without even a chance to eat breakfast. As he went through his morning classes,
        his hunger & poor start to the day was affecting his mood, and it made him hard to work with. Classmates he normally gets along well with were put off by his attitude.
        He even did poorly on short exit ticket quizzes. He was clearly struggling to focus on anything productive.

        As his only real break between classes approached, he decided that he had to get some food to get through the rest of the day. He knew his only chance to get a meal 
        in was by ordering something ahead of time for the hour gap between classes. Despite being in the middle of a lecture full of other students, he pulled out his phone
        to put together a mobile order on this app fully expecting to be able to put together & finish his order in less than a few minutes. He was in no mood to worry about
        what his classmates could see on his screen, but he obviously expects the app not to broadcast any of his personal or banking information to those around him. His 
        WiFi connection was spotty at best as it tends to be on campus WiFi, but a simple app like this should be able to load the menus just fine. The app shouldn't make 
        any sounds to distract those around him, and screens shouldn't be hard to read in a reasonably well-lit classroom. He doesn't even want to see closed restaurants 
        since these are useless to him. He also expects to know which nearby restaurants on campus are capable of getting his order ready by the time he is out of his 
        class since he doesn't have time to wait nearby for his order to finish being prepared. He needs the minimum time possible between arriving to pick up his order 
        & sating his hunger, and the app should facilitate that.

    This user story served to remind me of the project's goals. It represents somewhat of a caricature of the most difficult 
    portion of the target audience to appease, but Alex is also someone we've all been at one time or another as a student. As
    such, wanted to ensure that the app could be used painlessly by even the most agitated college student. Not only does this mean
    the layout and workflows should remain simple, but it should also utilize industry standards to make the design as familiar
    as possible. I looked at a variety of major mobile-ordering apps and used inspiration from what they all do to design familiar
    elements like the confirmation/add to cart button, tiles for restaurants and items, and a standard header layout. This brought
    me to my initial sketches:
