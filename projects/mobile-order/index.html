<h2 id="introduction--motivation">Introduction &amp; Motivation</h2>
<p></p><p>As someone who often orders on the go between classes, I find that simplicity is the most important quality in
a mobile-ordering app. At times, I find the current solution at my university at odds with this value, and there
are things I would like to see changed about it. This is a sentiment I&#x27;ve also had shared with me by other students,
especially in relation to this project. Getting solid nutrition into your daily routine despite the busy schedules of
college students shouldn&#x27;t require jumping through hoops. A mobile-ordering apps whould improve the user&#x27;s life by
conveniently and simply providing a way to make sure a meal is ready when you are. As such, my goal is to redesign my
university&#x27;s dining app to unite users with their next meal as fast as possible.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>As implied by the word &quot;mobile,&quot; this app is designed specifically around phones. While a desktop version of the
app would also be helpful to students looking to order during the tail-end of a class, it was not the focus for
the scope of this project. I think a desktop app or website would be worth looking into if this app was fully implemented though.
Regardless, mobile is the main concern here as this app is as much about simplicity as it as ordering on the go. Users
need to be able to set up their next meal while transitioning between classes, activities, work, and any other obligations.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The design was made to be lightweight and easy to navigate so that no time should be wasted fumbling
through menus while hunger is at stake. Additionally, I think that everyone deserves to have the information necessary
to make informed decisions about the food they put in their body. At a bare minimum, caloric information should be
provided on all foods you order so that you can take it into consideration if you choose to.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Throughout this project, I&#x27;ve worked as the sole designer and developer. In general, I haven&#x27;t worked on all that many
software projects solo or as a lead, so this was a relatively new experience for me. The entire creative process was
my own, and I had to learn more about building something from nothing. A lot of the lessons in this project for me
came from learning how to brainstorm smarter and how to iterate on strong initial concepts through user testing and
reflection to create something presentable.</p><p></p>
<br>
<h2 id="early-design-process">Early Design Process</h2>
<p></p><p>Once I knew I wanted to redesign the mobile-ordering app, I began with further identifying the target audience. After
interviewing two of my close friends and discovering their motiviations for placing mobile orders as well as their pain points
with the current implementation, I drafted the following user story:</p><p></p>
<div style="display:flex;width:100%;justify-content:center"><p style="width:75%;text-align:center"></p><p>Alex is a Junior business administration major at UNL with very little tech background outside of using a smartphone and little patience.
On one Monday morning, nothing seemed to be going right. He woke up late after sleeping through multiple alarms. He flew out the door without
a shower after waking up and seeing on his phone that he only has 15 minutes until his first class. Despite flooring his car down every street he could,
he hit every light red and arrived to his first sequence of classes late without even a chance to eat breakfast. As he went through his morning classes,
his hunger &amp; poor start to the day was affecting his mood, and it made him hard to work with. Classmates he normally gets along well with were put off by his attitude.
He even did poorly on short exit ticket quizzes. He was clearly struggling to focus on anything productive.</p><p>As his only real break between classes approached, he decided that he had to get some food to get through the rest of the day. He knew his only chance to get a meal
in was by ordering something ahead of time for the hour gap between classes. Despite being in the middle of a lecture full of other students, he pulled out his phone
to put together a mobile order on this app fully expecting to be able to put together &amp; finish his order in less than a few minutes. He was in no mood to worry about
what his classmates could see on his screen, but he obviously expects the app not to broadcast any of his personal or banking information to those around him. His
WiFi connection was spotty at best as it tends to be on campus WiFi, but a simple app like this should be able to load the menus just fine. The app shouldn&#x27;t make
any sounds to distract those around him, and screens shouldn&#x27;t be hard to read in a reasonably well-lit classroom. He doesn&#x27;t even want to see closed restaurants
since these are useless to him. He also expects to know which nearby restaurants on campus are capable of getting his order ready by the time he is out of his
class since he doesn&#x27;t have time to wait nearby for his order to finish being prepared. He needs the minimum time possible between arriving to pick up his order
&amp; sating his hunger, and the app should facilitate that.</p><p></p></div>
<p></p><p>This user story served to remind me of the project&#x27;s goals. It represents somewhat of a caricature of the most difficult
portion of the target audience to appease, but Alex is also someone we&#x27;ve all been at one time or another as a student. As
such, wanted to ensure that the app could be used painlessly by even the most agitated college student. Not only does this mean
the layout and workflows should remain simple, but it should also utilize industry standards to make the design as familiar
as possible. I looked at a variety of major mobile-ordering apps and used inspiration from what they all do to design familiar
elements like the confirmation/add to cart button, tiles for restaurants and items, and a standard header layout. This brought
me to my initial sketches:</p><p></p></div><div class="slider-container"><div class="slick-slider slick-initialized" dir="ltr" style="width:60%"><button type="button" data-role="none" class="slick-arrow slick-prev slick-disabled" style="display:block"> <!-- -->Previous</button><div class="slick-list"><div class="slick-track" style="width:700%;left:0%"><div data-index="0" class="slick-slide slick-active slick-current" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="false" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch1-d03408d2c0cf431ca30a68ce4a8c952f.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on the homepage collapsed" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="1" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch2-5a36d4ff9c1f1cdfe62c7e951e3f3fb9.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on the homepage expanded" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="2" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch3-17866475f77d4ce9f61a436d085068a0.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on a restaurant&#x27;s page expanded" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="3" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch4-0087d32c7d5a5f28c5f9b9fb553a083c.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app&#x27;s page for ordering an individual item" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="4" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch5-ddde5b51d1e6a9edcad67fd35a40f4fc.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with payment inputs" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="5" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch6-ae18535fe386550bf6aa0d9033c4d323.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with saved payment information" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="6" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:14.285714285714286%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/sketch7-e2bc5e7337ecee07c5056e258f5601c2.PNG" alt="A sketch of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with a confirmation popup" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div></div></div><button type="button" data-role="none" class="slick-arrow slick-next" style="display:block"> <!-- -->Next</button><ul style="display:block" class="slick-dots"><li class="slick-active"><button>1</button></li><li><button>2</button></li><li><button>3</button></li><li><button>4</button></li><li><button>5</button></li><li><button>6</button></li><li><button>7</button></li></ul></div></div><div><p></p><p>With these sketches as a basis, I began to list out all the components necessary to build an early
design system which would allow me to make proper mockups. In building this system, I decided to keep
it light on colors as this would essentially be the white label version of the app which universities
could customize to their own color scheme, logo, and other differentiating elements. In hindsight, I
wish I had done more research into what was necessary to use my university&#x27;s branding as the white label
aspects seemed to confuse a lot of users in my testing (which will be discussed more later). I learned that
people were expecting more of a finished product that they would see on campus while I was approaching
the mockups and subsequent prototype as more of an abstract representation of the app. Regardless,
this was the decision I made at the time, and I stuck with it to the end for good or ill.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Additionally, I chose to give the app a bottom navbar similar to what you would see on an Android phone
as one of my initial interviewees complained about the lack of back buttons in the current app. Again,
hindsight is 20/20 here, and if I were to go back, I would include only a contextual, floating back button
and allow the app&#x27;s icon to be the home button. The &quot;more&quot; tab was another feature I put in as a placeholder,
but this attracted a lot more attention than I intended it to. I never had solid plans for what to put in that
menu, so I would remove it entirely if I were to start from scratch or do a proper overhaul.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Another choice I made in my design system was to keep the fonts quite large. At a certain point, I thought
some of the headers came out a bit excessive, and I did eventually shrink them slightly for more real estate
for other features. However, the large font ended up being one of the things I got continuous positive
feedback about. Users really loved it, and I think I&#x27;ll continue to stick to large fonts in future
designs where possible.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Having made these core design decisions, I began work on the original mockups which I would iterate on until
the final prototype. You can view these early mockups below as well as the first Figma prototype of the app:</p><p></p></div><div class="slider-container"><div class="slick-slider slick-initialized" dir="ltr" style="width:60%"><button type="button" data-role="none" class="slick-arrow slick-prev slick-disabled" style="display:block"> <!-- -->Previous</button><div class="slick-list"><div class="slick-track" style="width:800%;left:0%"><div data-index="0" class="slick-slide slick-active slick-current" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="false" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/homepage-collapsed-eb95de0701ba0f2abb61eb86ccf57a60.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on the homepage collapsed" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="1" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/homepage-expanded-336061ea47e8393ec494f400bad1dc38.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on the homepage expanded" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="2" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/restaurant-collapsed-4c9420f2aef1f1d39aba0266637f2baf.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on a restaurant&#x27;s page collapsed" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="3" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/restaurant-expanded-4bb663d457b165557d6772bc3a75faf9.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app with all dropdowns on a restaurant&#x27;s page expanded" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="4" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/item-page-bd4f5fba4774edae397d1206008147ce.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app&#x27;s page for ordering an individual item" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="5" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/checkout-payment-inputs-b68883460038a9d59d42d1a297a20d7a.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with payment inputs" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="6" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/checkout-saved-payments-d7be9723cbc928ebadcf16c3229dd2b5.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with saved payment information" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div><div data-index="7" class="slick-slide" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="outline:none;width:12.5%"><div><img src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/checkout-confirmation-a254e33878291abc3899cc2427fe3153.png" alt="A mockup of a mobile order app&#x27;s checkout page with a confirmation popup" tabindex="-1" style="width:100%;display:inline-block"></div></div></div></div><button type="button" data-role="none" class="slick-arrow slick-next" style="display:block"> <!-- -->Next</button><ul style="display:block" class="slick-dots"><li class="slick-active"><button>1</button></li><li><button>2</button></li><li><button>3</button></li><li><button>4</button></li><li><button>5</button></li><li><button>6</button></li><li><button>7</button></li><li><button>8</button></li></ul></div></div><p style="margin:2rem 0">In the prototype below, you are able to navigate from the homepage to one restaurant and add one menu item to your cart. This is because I decided that implementing tens of pages for unique restaurants and items would be outside the scope of this prototype and something that would almost be easier to implmement in a real application than in Figma. You are also only able to expand the first dropdown of each screen for similar reasons as there would be several iterations of each page to make every combination of dropdown state possible. Another limitation of the prototype is that I was not able to add a bubble to the cart showing it has something in it after placing an order with the free version of Figma, but this is something I would want in a real application. After adding an item to cart (or really at any time), you&#x27;re able to hit the cart icon in the top right to work through the checkout page. You can only confirm your payment info and place your order as the input fields are not functional.</p><div style="text-align:center" width="100%"><iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="54%" height="800" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/9wgqJFQAHbK0LrwVB4hQaC/Mobile-Order-Early-Prototype?node-id=96-1035&amp;node-type=canvas&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=96%3A1035&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe></div><div><p style="margin-top:2rem"></p><p>The first iteration of the prototype was quite rough as I was really struggling to get my
bearings in Figma, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make my app properly fit a device frame.
Part of this was down to the dimensions of my app, but it also depended on a silly decision
I made by showing tiles leading off the page in an attempt to indicate that they were
scrollable. Though this made sense in my head at the time, the only way I could think to do
this was to cover the cut off portions with a black box. I didn&#x27;t learn until later that
there are techniques to make something properly scrollable in Figma, and by that point,
I scrapped the idea and moved away from scrolling entirely. Once I figured out the
issue with my dimensions being too short, it already felt too late in the project to
fully redesign multiple pages or extend the content to fit the dimensions of a real
phone, so I unframed the prototype and continued on which you will see in the final
prototype.</p><p></p>
<h2 id="user-testing--iteration">User Testing &amp; Iteration</h2>
<p></p><p>Upon completing the early prototype, I began user testing with colleagues of mine also
interested in design as well as possible end-users. These were all college students who had at least some familiarity
with the current mobile-ordering app, but not all of them use or have used the app personally.
Testers were read a script which outlined the parameters of the test such as how the data
would be used and who would have access to it (which was basically just me). I then asked
the testers to attempt to place an order through the app while speaking their thought
process out loud as well as anything that stood out to them as a strength or
weakness of the design.
I admittedly did not gain as much feedback during this initial session as I would have liked.
I was given generally positive feedback about the layout and overall simplicity of the app
which is a positive as that was a core value from the start, but I was hoping for more issues
to be pointed out besides the prototype not fitting the frame and other things of that nature.
Ultimately, I feel I learned the most by reflecting on how people attempted to interact with the
app rather than what they told me.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>For example, every user who tested the prototype tried to click the order confirmation button before
filling out credit card info. In some sense, this was a kayak problem that everyone
recovered from shortly after. However, fixing the confirm button was a trivial point to avoid
something that every user who tested the app was running into. At the time, the button was still
green, but it was translucent in an attempt to communicate that it couldn&#x27;t be used yet. After
bringing it up to one of my colleagues that every user had done that so far, he suggested that
I make the button gray rather than translucent. I took this feedback and implemented this small
change. Though I would still see some users immediately click the button only to realize that
they must first set up the payment info, it decreased the number of users who thought this was
a clickable button overall.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>As it was an elephant in the room, I then chose to address the poor framing and centering of
the prototype. As mentioned above, I never fully fixed this problem as even the current prototype
is not long enough to fit a real mobile device frame. However, the original implementation was
so glaringly bad that I had to scrap it by ceasing to pretend that restaurants and items would
be scrollable. I then removed the frame as I figured having no frame was better than it being
poorly framed. This is still how it&#x27;s done in the final prototype unfortunately.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>I also realized during testing that I didn&#x27;t do anything to alleviate one of my core issues with the
real app. My prototype just listed the item options (e.g. toppings) as text that
can&#x27;t be selected individually to edit one without worrying about the rest. In the current app, you
must go through context menus for every option/topping on the item to edit a single one and add it
back to your cart. Since this is something I aimed to fix from the start, I wanted to go back and
separate the options into their own links which take you back to the customization page. In doing so,
I created distinct links for each option that could be clicked in the final prototype. However, I
did not implement more than one topping to the item page, so the effect of this was somewhat lost
and it became another abstract representation that didn&#x27;t translate well to the prototype. Additionally,
these links are still quite small and close together which is something I would adress given future
iteration.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Another thing I noticed during testing was that I did not like the look of the thicker divider
which separates major page elements (such as the favorites from restaurant/item groups). It did
not have the negative space effect I intended for it to have. This stood out to me as just a block of
gray on the page which looks poor. I found the sizing to be okay, so I wasn&#x27;t fully sure why it didn&#x27;t
give the effect I wanted. After looking at other apps for inspiration, I realized that the main issue
was that it didn&#x27;t fit the color scheme of the app. I was using gray to attempt to portray negative
space in an app that used all off-white backgrounds. By changing the color of the divider to something
derived from the off-white background but more pale and subdued, I was able to better achieve the
negative space feeling I was looking for. I&#x27;m quite happy with how this turned out in the final
prototype, and I wouldn&#x27;t adjust it further.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>For a final example of a change I made from user testing, I decided to shrink some of the headers
as previously mentioned. This was in part due to feedback from one colleague of mine, but I also
had my own feelings that they were too much in some areas and didn&#x27;t allow for as many other
elements on the page as there should&#x27;ve been. However, most testers actually commented that they
liked how large the text was, and that if I were to decrease it, I should be very careful with
doing so. I only decreased the font by a few points, and I think the app is better off for it.
It made room for more elements on the page, but it still retained the large and easy-to-read
aspects that many testers enjoyed.</p><p></p>
<h2 id="final-design-system-and-prototype">Final Design System and Prototype</h2>
<p></p><p>With the iteration from user testing done, I was able to put the finishing touches on my
design system. While there is still a lot more to be done to make this a polished design for
a production application, I&#x27;m happy with the progress I&#x27;ve made as a designer through this
project, and I&#x27;ve chosen to stop here. It feels like I&#x27;ve accrued too much tech debt
to get the prototype where it currently is, and I would rather start from scratch than
continue to work from the mistakes I made from the start (especially with my initial poor
understanding of Figma components). Ultimately, I feel that it still captures the simplicity
that I aimed for from the beginning, and I&#x27;m glad to have been able to maintain a better
focus on health than the current application by including a space for caloric information
as well as full nutrition details if provided. Below, you can view the final design
system:</p><p></p></div><iframe style="height:45vh" width="100%" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/o7e4LOpFPTZs2VxY1IkdzQ/Mobile-Order-Design-System?node-id=0-1&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe><p style="margin:2rem 0">In the final prototype below, you will find that the overall workflow has not been adjusted much from the initial iteration. Some additional features have been added such as the abilities to choose whether you card should be saved or not and to change the topping on an item as I felt these were both important aspects to have functional in the final prototype. Overall, the other changes besides those described in the section above include minor polishing of things like spacing and borders. Had I committed more time to this project, I would have liked to start weakening and outright removing many of the hard black borders on elements as I was given feedback on how this makes it look a bit dated. I agree with this assessment, but that was how I envisioned it from the start. I didn&#x27;t realize how much sleeker things could look by simply removing borders until I made this change to the green confirmation buttons on the app. I chose to keep this change as it looks good on its own, but I would&#x27;ve needed to make changes to so many elements of the design system to give the rest of the elements a consistent look and feel with lesser borders. This realization came when I was already beginning to sunset the project unfortunately.</p><div style="text-align:center" width="100%"><iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="54%" height="800" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/o7e4LOpFPTZs2VxY1IkdzQ/Mobile-Order-Design-System?node-id=96-1848&amp;node-type=canvas&amp;scaling=contain&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;starting-point-node-id=96%3A1035&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p></p><p>Though I&#x27;ve ended this project in a less polished state than I would have liked to, I&#x27;m still
grateful for the lessons I&#x27;ve learned. I&#x27;ve identified that while I&#x27;m happy with my ability to
identify problems, brainstorm solutions, and design general layouts, I still struggle
with the fine arts and prototyping aspects of design. I can picture a great design in my head,
but I struggle to put it to paper (metaphorically) in a way that is satisfying to my goals.
I hope to continue to iterate on these weaknesses through future projects in an attempt to
round out my skills as a designer and developer.</p><p></p></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/projects/mobile-order">Mobile Order Project</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog">Latest Blog Post</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/jnichols12/jake-ui-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Jake Nichols UI Portfolio.
