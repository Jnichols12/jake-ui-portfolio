It\'s often relegated to its connotations of royalty, mystique,\\r\\nor flamboyancy, but I personally agree with the sentiment that purples on the blue end of the spectrum can appear very elegant & dignified. It\'s eye-catching\\r\\nbut in a subtler sense than a bright orange or deep red. Purple makes a statement without screaming at you to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to those who choose to listen is how I like to view my own approach to conversation. I don\'t take my place in a conversation\\r\\nby being the loudest but simply by having something to say. Sometimes this may get drowned out by louder voices such as the oranges & reds of the world, but\\r\\nthe reserved thoughts are there for those who choose to listen. Perhaps this has nothing to do with purple, and I\'m just projecting my personality onto\\r\\nmy favorite color. Perhaps my personality lead me to choose a color I identify with. \\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps purple has influenced my personality... much like the personality of this portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Eiseman, Leatrice.
