As I've worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would\r\nexpect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on.

The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,\r\nbut I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night.
