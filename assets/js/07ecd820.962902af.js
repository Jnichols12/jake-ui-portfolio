Each student chose a population for which designers need to meet\r\ncertain accessibility standards to properly accommodate. The name UIUN comes from the activity being modeled after a United\r\nNations meeting in which individuals represent the needs of their country. As someone who originally intended to minor in\r\nSpanish in college, I decided to represent the non-native English-speaking/English as a Second Language (ESL) population.\r\nWe first gave brief introductions to our population based on initial research.

Unfortunately, I found this to be the weakest\r\naspect of the activity. I think we had a pretty non-confrontational group who wasn't interested in having heated discussions over\r\nan activity such as this (including myself). For the most part, one person lead the discussions.

Requirements started having unrelated things tacked on in an\r\nattempt to satisfy more populations. I don\'t think this was realistic to the amount of effort necessary to complete each requirement\r\nthat got packed together as we were supposed to have a limited budget on priorities.

Additionally, children under 13 were a strong ally, but I did predict this since children are also generally at\r\na point where they are still learning English and how to fully comprehend it. We also unfortunately didn't have a representative\r\npresent for a population reliant on screen readers. However, one student chose to play that part briefly which threw a wrench\r\nin things. Though in a real project, you would absolutely develop for screen readers from the start, we had neglected this until\r\nthe end and basically had to convince them that we couldn't afford that anymore.
