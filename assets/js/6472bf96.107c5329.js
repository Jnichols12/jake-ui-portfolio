This was designed\\r\\nto be a bit of a workshop that was meant to induce negotiations between students about the accessibility needs of certain\\r\\npopulations in a mock redesign of a government website. Each student chose a population for which designers need to meet\\r\\ncertain accessibility standards to properly accommodate. The name UIUN comes from the activity being modeled after a United\\r\\nNations meeting in which individuals represent the needs of their country. As someone who originally intended to minor in\\r\\nSpanish in college, I decided to represent the non-native English-speaking/English as a Second Language (ESL) population.\\r\\nWe first gave brief introductions to our population based on initial research. We then designed presentations covering our\\r\\npopulation\'s needs in-depth, and finally, we held negotiations over the most important requirements to make it into a\\r\\nredesigned local election site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off the bat, I had assumed that vocabulary would be the biggest hurdle for my population.\\r\\nHaving taken four years of Spanish, I was generally able to parse the meaning of a sentence with enough time even if I\\r\\ndidn\'t fully understand the grammar, but vocab isn\'t something you can really intuit unless words are conjugates or there\\r\\nare enough context clues. Upon further research, this was supported by an article from Bay Atlantic University over the\\r\\nchallenges ESL students face in the classroom.[^1] Unfortunately, this was one of the only strong pieces of research I was able to\\r\\nfind on my population. While there are lots of guidelines and standards for inclusive design regarding populations who\\r\\ndepend on screen readers for example, ESL doesn\'t have the same standards when designing with accessibility in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the research of my presentation, I essentially just had to extrapolate from the needs of\\r\\nESL students in the classroom as well as from Census data. Though not ideal, I was able to come up with another major need \\r\\nof non-native English speakers which is clear FAQ and instructions to prevent the need to speak to a live representative.\\r\\nSpeaking and listening were the hardest skills in my Spanish journey, and my research backed up that one of the biggest\\r\\nstruggles for ESL students is finding confidence and motivation to engage with others in English.[^1] I focused my\\r\\nrequirements around these two points. Additionally, anything that makes the text itself more difficult to parse is an added\\r\\nbarrier to any population, especially those who have trouble comprehending meaning. For this reason, I included a requirement\\r\\nregarding clear and adjustable fonts. You can read the three requirements for my population in full here:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t+ Flesch-Kincade testing should be used as a sanity check on all pages to ensure that writing is kept to a reasonable level such as 7th - 8th grade.\\r\\n\\t+ All necessary information to vote should be available and clear online to prevent the need to speak to an English-speaking representative. \\r\\n\\t+ Adjustable fonts should be available to minimize struggles that aren\'t related to comprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After presentations concluded, we met as a group and tried to list, rank, and choose the roughly 4-5\\r\\nmost important requirements which could gain support from multiple populations. Unfortunately, I found this to be the weakest\\r\\naspect of the activity. I think we had a pretty non-confrontational group who wasn\'t interested in having heated discussions over\\r\\nan activity such as this (including myself). For the most part, one person lead the discussions. I don\'t know that anyone fought\\r\\ntoo hard over what they wanted, and we didn\'t really mark anything that wasn\'t unanimous or at least that everyone felt indifferent \\r\\nabout. Towards the end, I tried to push the 7th - 8th grade writing level requirement as it had a lot of support from other groups,\\r\\nbut I felt this was mostly shut down on pedantic reasons such as the wording of the requirement as it was listed in our ranking\\r\\nrather than the requirement itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of negotiations, our requirements became a lot messier as it was suggested by the moderator\\r\\nthat we could pack multiple issues into one \\"bill\\" much like the worst aspect of the American political system which prevents nearly\\r\\nall bipartisan initiatives from passing in Congress, but I digress. Requirements started having unrelated things tacked on in an\\r\\nattempt to satisfy more populations. I don\'t think this was realistic to the amount of effort necessary to complete each requirement\\r\\nthat got packed together as we were supposed to have a limited budget on priorities. Overall, this derailed the negotation aspect and\\r\\ndiminished the quality of the exercise in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that surprised me about negotiations was the amount of overlap my requirements had with\\r\\nthe population of people with Dyslexia. In hindsight, this makes sense as both populations primarily struggle with language and\\r\\ncomprehension. Additionally, children under 13 were a strong ally, but I did predict this since children are also generally at\\r\\na point where they are still learning English and how to fully comprehend it. We also unfortunately didn\'t have a representative\\r\\npresent for a population reliant on screen readers. However, one student chose to play that part briefly which threw a wrench\\r\\nin things. Though in a real project, you would absolutely develop for screen readers from the start, we had neglected this until\\r\\nthe end and basically had to convince them that we couldn\'t afford that anymore. Feeling forced to deny a major requirement for\\r\\nsuch a large portion of web users wasn\'t a great feeling. However, I think this came down more to the structure of the activity\\r\\nand the order in which we proceeded rather than a realistic representation of design.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the summit was an interesting (albeit flawed) exercise in inclusive design. While it got \\r\\nme thinking more about the importance of designing for populations with accessibility needs, I think it would\'ve been more productive \\r\\nwithout some of the strange constraints around the negotiations and a more involved group. If there\'s one takeaway I can pull from this,\\r\\nit\'s that if put in a situation like this in industry, I realize now that you have to fight for a population\'s needs if you want them \\r\\nto make it into an already packed backlog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Bay Atlantic University \\"ESL Students Challenges: Overcoming Language Obstacles.\\" Bay Atlantic University - Washington, D.C., 15 Mar. 2024, bau.edu/blog/esl-students-challenges/."},{"id":"/constraints","metadata":{"permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/constraints","source":"@site/blog/constraints.md","title":"Clarity in Constraints","description":"This blog post is a reflection of chapter 4 of Don Norman\'s The Design of Everyday Things.","date":"2024-10-31T17:59:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"WordJournal","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/wordjournal","description":"Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.

For this reason, UIs should aim to use globally-recognizable standards when inducing constraints or at\\r\\nleast specify the standard which they\'re expecting. \\r\\nIt may feel tempting to design specifically for users of the country you live in because that is the first market you want to capture.\\r\\nHowever, this is bound to lead to confusion down the line if your application grows into something bigger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious example of a poor cultural constraint is designing an application such that it expects weight \\r\\nin pounds without clarifying this to the user.

This piece came from an artist known as Julius Schmidt from Stamford, Connecticut. The piece unfortunately is only labeled\\r\\nas \\"Untitled Relief,\\" but this should be enough to find it for yourself if you\'d like. The piece is a cast iron sculpture with little\\r\\nnotion of any overarching ideas. Rather, it has many cut-outs with all kinds of intricate designs. In the following sections, I\'ll be \\r\\nanalyzing three of my favorite aspects of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Labyrinthian</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not all sections of the design have open routes to each other, the overall design reminds me of a\\r\\nlabyrinth or maze-like structure. Due to the ties of labyrinths to ancient cultures such as Egypt, Greece, & Crete,[^1] this brought me back\\r\\nto reading books about Greek mythology as a child. I\'ve always found the subject interesting, so attempting to build a UI that ties into\\r\\nmythology seems like fun. Though labyrinthian design is in some ways antithetical to UI design (UIs should be simple, not eternally confusing),\\r\\nI think a maze could make for a good logo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Archaic</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a stretch as the piece was actually created in the 1960s, but I find that it resembles something\\r\\nyou would see at a historic site of an ancient city. As a cast iron piece stored outside, it is now rusty and archaic looking. Again, I\'ve chosen an\\r\\naspect that should probably be avoided in UI design since it shouldn\'t feel dated, but I think I can continue to tie this in with the theme of\\r\\nGreek mythology. Though not often thought about this way due to the lack of printing, fonts were used in many ancient civilizations for consistency in \\r\\nlabeling,[^2] so I think using a primitive Greek-esque font in stylized aspects of the page could further connect to the mythology theme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Lack of Negative Space</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yet another aspect that probably isn\'t suitable for UI design, I quite like the lack of negative space in this\\r\\nsculpture. Almost everything about it is highly-designed and busy. Despite thinking this is great for a piece that feels like a labyrinth, it\\r\\nstands out as something I should approach in the opposite manner for a UI design. I\'m not sure if there\'s a term for what I\'m thinking of as\\r\\nnegative inspiration in this sense, but it leads me to want to keep my composition simple. Negative space is a powerful tool for exactly that.[^3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those aspects of inspiration laid out, below is my UI sketch for a mobile app catalog of Greek mythology stories and books.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/greek_ui.jpg \\"A UI sketch of a mobile catalog for Greek mythology\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Mobile Mythology Catalog</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This app would be similar to something like Libby or Kindle where you can search for new works to read, save them to\\r\\na reading list, and read the work from directly within the app. Though I tried to make the styling feel ancient Greece themed with headers and icons,\\r\\nI would keep longer strings of text to a more standard font to make them easier to read. I decided to also go with a maze for the logo to match\\r\\nthe labyrinth inspiration. Had I iterated on this more, I think the maze should have a more distinct pattern to it rather than a generic maze. It fits\\r\\nthe theme less, but I think it would help the logo stick better in the minds of users. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I\'m not sure if I fully succeeded in using negative space here\\r\\nsince the app seems a little packed, but it\'s hard not to use all the space you\'re given when designing a mobile app. There\'s some amount of space between\\r\\ncards on the carousels which is probably the most significant use of negative space here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I\'m pretty satisfied with the result of this exercise. I\'ve found that inspiration from traditional sources\\r\\ncan be interpreted in unconventional manners to create something that still follows good design principles. When looking for a place to start on \\r\\nsomething new, perhaps an underrated place to look is at something old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Callaway, Linda. \\"The Symbolism of Labyrinths: A Journey through Mystery and Meaning.\\" Symbol Genie, 25 Aug. 2023, www.symbolgenie.com/symbolism-of-labyrinths/. \\r\\n\\t[^2]: Fontfabric. \\"History and Evolution of Typography - Extended.\\" Fontfabric, 20 Oct. 2023, www.fontfabric.com/blog/history-and-evolution-of-typography-fonts-timeline/. \\r\\n\\t[^3]: DeGuzman, Kyle. \\"How to Use Negative Space in Composition.\\" StudioBinder, 31 Jan. 2023, www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-negative-space-definition/."},{"id":"/colors-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-3","source":"@site/blog/colors3.md","title":"How Different Colors Can Change a UI\'s Mood","description":"This blog post contains a few recreations of a login screen for one of my Ubuntu virtual machines.","date":"2024-09-26T21:29:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":4.765,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Nichols","title":"Student","url":"https://github.com/jnichols12","imageURL":"/jake-ui-portfolio/img/jake_profile.jpg","key":"jake","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How Different Colors Can Change a UI\'s Mood","authors":"jake","slug":"/colors-3","date":"2024-09-26T21:29:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Finding Inspiration","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/finding-inspiration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Did I Choose Purple For My Portfolio?","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2"}},"content":"This blog post contains a few recreations of a login screen for one of my Ubuntu virtual machines. \\r\\nThe theme I use can be found here: <a href=\\"https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gnome-Look: Nordic Theme</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/UICrop.png \\"An Ubuntu login screen\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>My VM\'s Login Screen</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color scheme used for this theme could possibly be described as analogous since it\'s based on dark blues and blue greens.\\r\\nHowever, I think monochrome or perhaps even monotone (with the exception of the blue green highlights) is a better description of the theme depending if you \\r\\nview these as shades of blue or gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, these colors are meant to be easy on the eye. I feel that it\'s meant to create a calming mood for something that\\r\\nyou use regularly rather than being a vibrant or eye-catching design. That\'s not to say it isn\'t interesting as I think the colors here play off of each\\r\\nother perfectly. More information on the Nord theme can be found <a href=\\"https://github.com/nordtheme/nord\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an exercise, I\'ve attempted to recreate this login screen (minus the mountains in the background as that would be a nightmare) in\\r\\nthree varying color combinations to see the effect this has on the interface\'s mood. Below is the original mockup with the same color scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Original Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is a recreation of this design into something that pops off the screen much more. Instead of the Nord theme, I\'ve went for something\\r\\ncloser to a cyberpunk aesthetic.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/cyberpunk_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with cyberpunk colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Cyberpunk Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This color scheme obviously throws all the subtlety and ease of use out the window. Cyberpunk designs are meant to grab your attention\\r\\nfrom anything else due to the vibrant, somewhat clashy colors. I would say this is closest to an adventurous analogous color combination based on the blues\\r\\nand bright purple/pink with the addition of the yellow which doesn\'t fit that theme. In reality, I\'m not sure it matches any of the harmonious palettes of color theory.\\r\\nHowever, someone looking for a futuristic theme that pops may love a more refined version of this theme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up, I\'ve stuck with the modern/futuristic idea but switched over to a more minimalist palette of red and black.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/redline_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with minimalistic black and red colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Sleek Minimalist Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme returns to something much easier on the eye but in a less subdued way than the original theme. This is meant to feel modern if\\r\\nnot futuristic with the bold red accents. This has none of the natural edge of the orignal. Again, this doesn\'t really fit into one of the harmonious palettes since we\'re\\r\\nonly using one non-neutral color. However, it\'s still a great design for someone who wants some edge in their UI without sacrificing usability or inducing eye strain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I\'m intentionally picking a harmonious color palette of triads. For this, I\'ve picked the primary colors to aim for something\\r\\nmore childlike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/childlike_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with childlike colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Childlike Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This final mockup is closer to the cyberpunk aesthetic in the sense that it uses multiple strong colors which fight for your attention. It again\\r\\nlacks all of the subtlety of the minimalist and original designs, and it definitely has no roots in nature. As I\'ve worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would\\r\\nexpect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on. If for some unholy reason you decide\\r\\nthat your 6-year old needs to learn Linux, this UI is perfect for you. For anyone else, I can\'t really see this being a popular choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap this up, I\'d like to reflect on which of these color palettes I find most effective for a login screen. By effective, I\'m talking about\\r\\nwhich one uses colors that play off of each other in the best ways. This would also be the design I expect to be most popular were you to offer it on a theme store.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I\'m just going to get it out of the way that I think the original theme blows anything I made out of the water. Nord is a well-established \\r\\ncolor palette created by talented designers for something perfectly usable. It\'s grounded in nature, and I love dark, calming themes when it comes to something I want to use \\r\\nevery day. They\'ve obviously put much more effort into fine tuning the color choices to make sure everything works together. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I were to pick the most effective of my own color palettes, I really like how the red and black theme turned out for similar \\r\\nreasons that I like Nord. It\'s simple and something that I could look at during any time of the day. The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,\\r\\nbut I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night. They\'re too aggressive and bold for something I want to\\r\\nuse regularly. I think the red and black strikes a good balance between ease of use and boldness in the red accents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this exercise has helped me better understand how color palettes can completely change the mood of a UI despite none of the\\r\\nelements changing. This is important to remember as a designer since we always want to make sure we\'re choosing colors intentionally. Color combinations should always\\r\\ncomplement the use cases of interfaces instead of just being chosen haphazardly."},{"id":"/colors-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2","source":"@site/blog/colors2.md","title":"Why Did I Choose Purple For My Portfolio?","description":"The following blog post explains my reasoning based on Eiseman\'s The Complete Color Harmony for choosing purple as the primary color of this portfolio.","date":"2024-09-25T18:50:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":1.495,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Nichols","title":"Student","url":"https://github.com/jnichols12","imageURL":"/jake-ui-portfolio/img/jake_profile.jpg","key":"jake","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why Did I Choose Purple For My Portfolio?","authors":"jake","slug":"/colors-2","date":"2024-09-25T18:50:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Different Colors Can Change a UI\'s Mood","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Color is to Design as Spice is to Cooking","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-1"}},"content":"The following blog post explains my reasoning based on Eiseman\'s *The Complete Color Harmony[^1]* for choosing purple as the primary color of this portfolio.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/purple.jpeg \\"A sunset over a purple sky\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>In the Simplest Terms: Purple is Stunning</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I won\'t deny that purple being my favorite color plays a large role in the decision to use it here,\\r\\nthere are further reasons why I think it\'s a good choice for a UI (though to some degree, I\'m justifying this for the same reasons it\'s my favorite color).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find purple unique in the sense that you don\'t see it used often in more professional settings.

Though there may be a time and place for this type of\\r\\ndesign (Wikipedia comes to mind, but even they use some amount of color), most interfaces would be horribly boring without a good color scheme.
