UI design is supposed to involve\\r\\nartistic expression, so taking inspiration from traditional art may help design something you feel strongly about.\\r\\nAs such, I\'ve went out to find an art piece to take cues from in a UI sketch of my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this activity, I chose a piece from the Sheldon Art Museum on the University of Nebraska - Lincoln\\r\\ncampus. This piece came from an artist known as Julius Schmidt from Stamford, Connecticut. The piece unfortunately is only labeled\\r\\nas \\"Untitled Relief,\\" but this should be enough to find it for yourself if you\'d like. The piece is a cast iron sculpture with little\\r\\nnotion of any overarching ideas. Rather, it has many cut-outs with all kinds of intricate designs. In the following sections, I\'ll be \\r\\nanalyzing three of my favorite aspects of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Labyrinthian</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not all sections of the design have open routes to each other, the overall design reminds me of a\\r\\nlabyrinth or maze-like structure. Due to the ties of labyrinths to ancient cultures such as Egypt, Greece, & Crete,[^1] this brought me back\\r\\nto reading books about Greek mythology as a child. I\'ve always found the subject interesting, so attempting to build a UI that ties into\\r\\nmythology seems like fun. Though labyrinthian design is in some ways antithetical to UI design (UIs should be simple, not eternally confusing),\\r\\nI think a maze could make for a good logo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Archaic</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a stretch as the piece was actually created in the 1960s, but I find that it resembles something\\r\\nyou would see at a historic site of an ancient city. As a cast iron piece stored outside, it is now rusty and archaic looking. Again, I\'ve chosen an\\r\\naspect that should probably be avoided in UI design since it shouldn\'t feel dated, but I think I can continue to tie this in with the theme of\\r\\nGreek mythology. Though not often thought about this way due to the lack of printing, fonts were used in many ancient civilizations for consistency in \\r\\nlabeling,[^2] so I think using a primitive Greek-esque font in stylized aspects of the page could further connect to the mythology theme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Lack of Negative Space</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yet another aspect that probably isn\'t suitable for UI design, I quite like the lack of negative space in this\\r\\nsculpture. Almost everything about it is highly-designed and busy. Despite thinking this is great for a piece that feels like a labyrinth, it\\r\\nstands out as something I should approach in the opposite manner for a UI design. I\'m not sure if there\'s a term for what I\'m thinking of as\\r\\nnegative inspiration in this sense, but it leads me to want to keep my composition simple. Negative space is a powerful tool for exactly that.[^3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those aspects of inspiration laid out, below is my UI sketch for a mobile app catalog of Greek mythology stories and books.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/greek_ui.jpg \\"A UI sketch of a mobile catalog for Greek mythology\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Mobile Mythology Catalog</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This app would be similar to something like Libby or Kindle where you can search for new works to read, save them to\\r\\na reading list, and read the work from directly within the app. Though I tried to make the styling feel ancient Greece themed with headers and icons,\\r\\nI would keep longer strings of text to a more standard font to make them easier to read. I decided to also go with a maze for the logo to match\\r\\nthe labyrinth inspiration. Had I iterated on this more, I think the maze should have a more distinct pattern to it rather than a generic maze. It fits\\r\\nthe theme less, but I think it would help the logo stick better in the minds of users. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I\'m not sure if I fully succeeded in using negative space here\\r\\nsince the app seems a little packed, but it\'s hard not to use all the space you\'re given when designing a mobile app. There\'s some amount of space between\\r\\ncards on the carousels which is probably the most significant use of negative space here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I\'m pretty satisfied with the result of this exercise. I\'ve found that inspiration from traditional sources\\r\\ncan be interpreted in unconventional manners to create something that still follows good design principles. When looking for a place to start on \\r\\nsomething new, perhaps an underrated place to look is at something old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Callaway, Linda. \\"The Symbolism of Labyrinths: A Journey through Mystery and Meaning.\\" Symbol Genie, 25 Aug. 2023, www.symbolgenie.com/symbolism-of-labyrinths/. \\r\\n\\t[^2]: Fontfabric. \\"History and Evolution of Typography - Extended.\\" Fontfabric, 20 Oct. 2023, www.fontfabric.com/blog/history-and-evolution-of-typography-fonts-timeline/. \\r\\n\\t[^3]: DeGuzman, Kyle. \\"How to Use Negative Space in Composition.\\" StudioBinder, 31 Jan. 2023, www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-negative-space-definition/."},{"id":"/colors-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-3","source":"@site/blog/colors3.md","title":"How Different Colors Can Change a UI\'s Mood","description":"This blog post contains a few recreations of a login screen for one of my Ubuntu virtual machines.","date":"2024-09-26T21:29:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":4.765,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Nichols","title":"Student","url":"https://github.com/jnichols12","imageURL":"/jake-ui-portfolio/img/jake_profile.jpg","key":"jake","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How Different Colors Can Change a UI\'s Mood","authors":"jake","slug":"/colors-3","date":"2024-09-26T21:29:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Finding Inspiration","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/finding-inspiration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Did I Choose Purple For My Portfolio?","permalink":"/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2"}},"content":"This blog post contains a few recreations of a login screen for one of my Ubuntu virtual machines. \\r\\nThe theme I use can be found here: <a href=\\"https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gnome-Look: Nordic Theme</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/UICrop.png \\"An Ubuntu login screen\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>My VM\'s Login Screen</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color scheme used for this theme could possibly be described as analogous since it\'s based on dark blues and blue greens.\\r\\nHowever, I think monochrome or perhaps even monotone (with the exception of the blue green highlights) is a better description of the theme depending if you \\r\\nview these as shades of blue or gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, these colors are meant to be easy on the eye. I feel that it\'s meant to create a calming mood for something that\\r\\nyou use regularly rather than being a vibrant or eye-catching design. That\'s not to say it isn\'t interesting as I think the colors here play off of each\\r\\nother perfectly. More information on the Nord theme can be found <a href=\\"https://github.com/nordtheme/nord\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an exercise, I\'ve attempted to recreate this login screen (minus the mountains in the background as that would be a nightmare) in\\r\\nthree varying color combinations to see the effect this has on the interface\'s mood. Below is the original mockup with the same color scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Original Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is a recreation of this design into something that pops off the screen much more. Instead of the Nord theme, I\'ve went for something\\r\\ncloser to a cyberpunk aesthetic.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/cyberpunk_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with cyberpunk colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Cyberpunk Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This color scheme obviously throws all the subtlety and ease of use out the window. Cyberpunk designs are meant to grab your attention\\r\\nfrom anything else due to the vibrant, somewhat clashy colors. I would say this is closest to an adventurous analogous color combination based on the blues\\r\\nand bright purple/pink with the addition of the yellow which doesn\'t fit that theme. In reality, I\'m not sure it matches any of the harmonious palettes of color theory.\\r\\nHowever, someone looking for a futuristic theme that pops may love a more refined version of this theme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up, I\'ve stuck with the modern/futuristic idea but switched over to a more minimalist palette of red and black.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/redline_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with minimalistic black and red colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Sleek Minimalist Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme returns to something much easier on the eye but in a less subdued way than the original theme. This is meant to feel modern if\\r\\nnot futuristic with the bold red accents. This has none of the natural edge of the orignal. Again, this doesn\'t really fit into one of the harmonious palettes since we\'re\\r\\nonly using one non-neutral color. However, it\'s still a great design for someone who wants some edge in their UI without sacrificing usability or inducing eye strain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I\'m intentionally picking a harmonious color palette of triads. For this, I\'ve picked the primary colors to aim for something\\r\\nmore childlike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](/img/childlike_mockup.png \\"A recreated Ubuntu login screen with childlike colors\\")\\r\\n<p style={{textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>Childlike Mockup</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This final mockup is closer to the cyberpunk aesthetic in the sense that it uses multiple strong colors which fight for your attention. It again\\r\\nlacks all of the subtlety of the minimalist and original designs, and it definitely has no roots in nature. As I\'ve worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would\\r\\nexpect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on. If for some unholy reason you decide\\r\\nthat your 6-year old needs to learn Linux, this UI is perfect for you. For anyone else, I can\'t really see this being a popular choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap this up, I\'d like to reflect on which of these color palettes I find most effective for a login screen. By effective, I\'m talking about\\r\\nwhich one uses colors that play off of each other in the best ways. This would also be the design I expect to be most popular were you to offer it on a theme store.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I\'m just going to get it out of the way that I think the original theme blows anything I made out of the water. Nord is a well-established \\r\\ncolor palette created by talented designers for something perfectly usable. It\'s grounded in nature, and I love dark, calming themes when it comes to something I want to use \\r\\nevery day. They\'ve obviously put much more effort into fine tuning the color choices to make sure everything works together. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I were to pick the most effective of my own color palettes, I really like how the red and black theme turned out for similar \\r\\nreasons that I like Nord. It\'s simple and something that I could look at during any time of the day. The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,\\r\\nbut I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night. They\'re too aggressive and bold for something I want to\\r\\nuse regularly. I think the red and black strikes a good balance between ease of use and boldness in the red accents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this exercise has helped me better understand how color palettes can completely change the mood of a UI despite none of the\\r\\nelements changing.

It\'s often relegated to its connotations of royalty, mystique,\\r\\nor flamboyancy, but I personally agree with the sentiment that purples on the blue end of the spectrum can appear very elegant & dignified. It\'s eye-catching\\r\\nbut in a subtler sense than a bright orange or deep red. Purple makes a statement without screaming at you to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to those who choose to listen is how I like to view my own approach to conversation. I don\'t take my place in a conversation\\r\\nby being the loudest but simply by having something to say.

Perhaps my personality lead me to choose a color I identify with. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps purple has influenced my personality... much like the personality of this portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Eiseman, Leatrice.

Sure, some people cook with\\r\\nlittle more than salt in the same way that some websites use simple black text on white backgrounds. Though there may be a time and place for this type of\\r\\ndesign (Wikipedia comes to mind, but even they use some amount of color), most interfaces would be horribly boring without a good color scheme. In the same\\r\\nway, salt may be all you need when cooking for picky eaters or just making something edible, but the dish will never reach the same heights it would with\\r\\na full flavor profile of spices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color doesn\'t often define an interface, but it\'s an almost necessary component to create something that will stick with users\\r\\nafter they stop interacting with your interface due to the emotional significance of color. Like spice, it\'s also important to pick the correct color combinations. \\r\\nThrowing everything & the kitchen sink into a dish or design is a good way to overwhelm users and create something with no identity. Color palettes are often created \\r\\nfrom three colors which play off of each other in one way or another just like a recipe often calls for a handful of complementary spices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color\'s importance and necessitation of both restraint and combination are important to remember for anyone going into UI design\\r\\nor really any career that relates to interfaces. Without understanding these concepts, you\'re bound to go too far to one end of the spectrum. Understanding\\r\\nhow to use smart color combinations and experiment to create your own unique themes will elevate everything from new UIs to simple updates of existing ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t[^1]: Eiseman, Leatrice.
