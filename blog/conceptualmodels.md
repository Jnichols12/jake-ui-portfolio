This blog post is a reflection of chapter 1 of Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things.[^1]*

<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Both lyrics and conceptual models have infinite interpretations</p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most songs have lyrics written with a level of depth & hidden meaning that their 
original intent is only fully understood by their writers. As the rest of us hear these songs, we piece together 
the lyrics into a story or message which we probably perceive as the intended one. We may not have even heard the correct
words in certain portions (this happens to me all the time) but manage to craft an understanding of the lyrics which we find coherent.
In some cases, we may even search out what insight the artist has given on a song and realize that our perception wasn't nearly as 
accurate as we realized. These concepts all have parallels in conceptual models such as forming a mental model from experimentation 
with affordances or interpreting signifiers, misinterpreting signifiers to mean something unintended, and consulting resources from
the designers to try to understand their conceptual model.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, tying these concepts to something I've experienced often in everyday life is 
a useful way to remember how wildly conceptual models can vary from person to person. This should be useful in my 
career as it's a reminder to design interfaces with signifiers that are as unambiguous as possible to try to 
transfer as much of my conceptual model to the user as possible.
