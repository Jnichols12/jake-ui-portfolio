This blog post is a reflection of chapters 8 & 9 of Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think.[^1]*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Prioritization</strong> is the main point I took away from Krug's thoughts
on how to debrief after a user test. It's important to narrow down the changes you intend to make based on feedback
to only the most important points. If you try to fix everything, you'll end up changing things which aren't truly
problems and just grievances of a particular user. Knowing how to identify the difference is key in prioritizing
the proper issues. In Krug's methodology, it's important to work with your team (assuming you have one) to debate
and collectively set the top priorities. This also allows others to stop you if you get too wrapped up in something
that doesn't really need a fix.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prioritization is a useful skill as a developer since you can often get caught up in
what you want to do rather than what's most beneficial to the project. Though some amount of this is the burden of
a project manager, it's still important to understand your priorities and to use your own judgement in tackling the
issues with the highest return on investment.
