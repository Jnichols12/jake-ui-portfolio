Summit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/language-48f98f0600b5bd7a5a234af87268ce18.jpeg" title="An image of hands holding up the word &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; in various languages" width="6138" height="2444" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>     Recently, I participated in an activity referred to as the UIUN Summit. This was designed
to be a bit of a workshop that was meant to induce negotiations between students about the accessibility needs of certain
populations in a mock redesign of a government website. Each student chose a population for which designers need to meet
certain accessibility standards to properly accommodate. The name UIUN comes from the activity being modeled after a United
Nations meeting in which individuals represent the needs of their country. As someone who originally intended to minor in
Spanish in college, I decided to represent the non-native English-speaking/English as a Second Language (ESL) population.
We first gave brief introductions to our population based on initial research. We then designed presentations covering our
population&#x27;s needs in-depth, and finally, we held negotiations over the most important requirements to make it into a
redesigned local election site.</p>
<p>     Off the bat, I had assumed that vocabulary would be the biggest hurdle for my population.
Having taken four years of Spanish, I was generally able to parse the meaning of a sentence with enough time even if I
didn&#x27;t fully understand the grammar, but vocab isn&#x27;t something you can really intuit unless words are conjugates or there
are enough context clues. Upon further research, this was supported by an article from Bay Atlantic University over the
challenges ESL students face in the classroom.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Unfortunately, this was one of the only strong pieces of research I was able to
find on my population. While there are lots of guidelines and standards for inclusive design regarding populations who
depend on screen readers for example, ESL doesn&#x27;t have the same standards when designing with accessibility in mind.</p>
<p>     For the research of my presentation, I essentially just had to extrapolate from the needs of
ESL students in the classroom as well as from Census data. Though not ideal, I was able to come up with another major need
of non-native English speakers which is clear FAQ and instructions to prevent the need to speak to a live representative.
Speaking and listening were the hardest skills in my Spanish journey, and my research backed up that one of the biggest
struggles for ESL students is finding confidence and motivation to engage with others in English.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> I focused my
requirements around these two points. Additionally, anything that makes the text itself more difficult to parse is an added
barrier to any population, especially those who have trouble comprehending meaning. For this reason, I included a requirement
regarding clear and adjustable fonts. You can read the three requirements for my population in full here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flesch-Kincade testing should be used as a sanity check on all pages to ensure that writing is kept to a reasonable level such as 7th - 8th grade.</li>
<li>All necessary information to vote should be available and clear online to prevent the need to speak to an English-speaking representative.</li>
<li>Adjustable fonts should be available to minimize struggles that aren&#x27;t related to comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p>     After presentations concluded, we met as a group and tried to list, rank, and choose the roughly 4-5
most important requirements which could gain support from multiple populations. Unfortunately, I found this to be the weakest
aspect of the activity. I think we had a pretty non-confrontational group who wasn&#x27;t interested in having heated discussions over
an activity such as this (including myself). For the most part, one person lead the discussions. I don&#x27;t know that anyone fought
too hard over what they wanted, and we didn&#x27;t really mark anything that wasn&#x27;t unanimous or at least that everyone felt indifferent
about. Towards the end, I tried to push the 7th - 8th grade writing level requirement as it had a lot of support from other groups,
but I felt this was mostly shut down on pedantic reasons such as the wording of the requirement as it was listed in our ranking
rather than the requirement itself.</p>
<p>     By the end of negotiations, our requirements became a lot messier as it was suggested by the moderator
that we could pack multiple issues into one &quot;bill&quot; much like the worst aspect of the American political system which prevents nearly
all bipartisan initiatives from passing in Congress, but I digress. Requirements started having unrelated things tacked on in an
attempt to satisfy more populations. I don&#x27;t think this was realistic to the amount of effort necessary to complete each requirement
that got packed together as we were supposed to have a limited budget on priorities. Overall, this derailed the negotation aspect and
diminished the quality of the exercise in my opinion.</p>
<p>     One thing that surprised me about negotiations was the amount of overlap my requirements had with
the population of people with Dyslexia. In hindsight, this makes sense as both populations primarily struggle with language and
comprehension. Additionally, children under 13 were a strong ally, but I did predict this since children are also generally at
a point where they are still learning English and how to fully comprehend it. We also unfortunately didn&#x27;t have a representative
present for a population reliant on screen readers. However, one student chose to play that part briefly which threw a wrench
in things. Though in a real project, you would absolutely develop for screen readers from the start, we had neglected this until
the end and basically had to convince them that we couldn&#x27;t afford that anymore. Feeling forced to deny a major requirement for
such a large portion of web users wasn&#x27;t a great feeling. However, I think this came down more to the structure of the activity
and the order in which we proceeded rather than a realistic representation of design.</p>
<p>     Ultimately, the summit was an interesting (albeit flawed) exercise in inclusive design. While it got
me thinking more about the importance of designing for populations with accessibility needs, I think it would&#x27;ve been more productive
without some of the strange constraints around the negotiations and a more involved group. If there&#x27;s one takeaway I can pull from this,
it&#x27;s that if put in a situation like this in industry, I realize now that you have to fight for a population&#x27;s needs if you want them
to make it into an already packed backlog.</p>

<p>     <strong>Clarity</strong> is an extremely important aspect of any part of design. In particular, constraints need
to be clear such that users won&#x27;t interpret what they&#x27;re allowed to do in wildly different ways. Cultural constraints in particular
can be grounds for lots of confusion. For this reason, UIs should aim to use globally-recognizable standards when inducing constraints or at
least specify the standard which they&#x27;re expecting.
It may feel tempting to design specifically for users of the country you live in because that is the first market you want to capture.
However, this is bound to lead to confusion down the line if your application grows into something bigger.</p>
<p>     One obvious example of a poor cultural constraint is designing an application such that it expects weight
in pounds without clarifying this to the user. While US users will mostly follow this constraint implicitly, nearly any other country
will give you data that you won&#x27;t be handling correctly. Though we don&#x27;t have a universal unit to use in a situation like this, specifying
the expected input format or allowing your users to select a unit preference is a simple solution to prevent ambiguity across cultures.</p>
<p>     At the company I work for, we have an entire department dedicated to addressing cultural constraints and
differences. While this isn&#x27;t necessary for every team, putting a little forethought into the cultural constraints of your application
is a surefire way to prevent unplanned for issues in a growing application.</p>

</p><p style="text-align:center">Accessibility features help everyone</p><p></p>
<p>     <strong>Everyone</strong> is the key word to remember when it comes to developing
accessibility features. While the first intinct for most of us when asked to think of who will benefit from
accessibility improvements is to imagine some stereotype of a person with a disability, anyone can benefit
form these features.</p>
<p>     Krug mentions that many resources use the tired example of closed captioning benefiting most
people, but this can be applied in so many other ways. As someone with ever-deteriorating eyesight (i.e. a human),
I find myself squinting more and more at small and even regular text sizes. Customizable font sizes go a long way in
improving a site&#x27;s accessibility for everyone.</p>
<p>     Another great accessibility feature comes from colorblind filters. While this is a little less of a serious example,
a lot of colorblind features allow users who don&#x27;t experience colorblindness to customize their experience. One way I see this used is in video
games where users will use certain colorblind filters to alter the appearance of an effect to their liking or perhaps make the game less aggressive to
their eyes.</p>
<p>     Regardless who your main user base is, accessiblity options are always important to keep in mind as a developer
since they can benefit everyone in ways you may never expect.</p>

</p><p style="text-align:center">Focus on the priorities</p><p></p>
<p>     <strong>Prioritization</strong> is the main point I took away from Krug&#x27;s thoughts
on how to debrief after a user test. It&#x27;s important to narrow down the changes you intend to make based on feedback
to only the most important points. If you try to fix everything, you&#x27;ll end up changing things which aren&#x27;t truly
problems and just grievances of a particular user. Knowing how to identify the difference is key in prioritizing
the proper issues. In Krug&#x27;s methodology, it&#x27;s important to work with your team (assuming you have one) to debate
and collectively set the top priorities. This also allows others to stop you if you get too wrapped up in something
that doesn&#x27;t really need a fix.</p>
<p>     Prioritization is a useful skill as a developer since you can often get caught up in
what you want to do rather than what&#x27;s most beneficial to the project. Though some amount of this is the burden of
a project manager, it&#x27;s still important to understand your priorities and to use your own judgement in tackling the
issues with the highest return on investment.</p>

</p><p style="text-align:center">Leave some space</p><p></p>
<p>     <strong>Space</strong> is necessary for your participants to provide good feedback
during a user test. It&#x27;s always tempting for me to ask railroading and leading questions. I tend to ask users and stakeholders
which of two options they prefer rather than finding out what they want. However, giving the space necessary to give
feedback on what a user actually wants or dislikes will lead to much more productive user testing. It&#x27;s important
to ask more general questions that allow users to explore and express their own thoughts.</p>
<p>     This is a lesson that&#x27;s useful in many aspects of a software development career. While
we&#x27;re applying it here to UI and usability, leaving space for feedback and organic responses can also be extremely
helpful in requirements elicitation or just general discussions with coworkers.</p>

<p>     <strong>Focus</strong> is the word that stands out to me from the article. Both giving &amp; receiving feedback
are based heavily on where you place your focus. When giving negative feedback, it&#x27;s important to focus on what&#x27;s wrong and what can be
improved rather than broad statements about quality or shortcomings of the designer. Giving direct, actionable feedback on how to improve
the product helps prevent the developer from feeling like the feedback is a criticism of themself.</p>
<p>     As a designer receiving negative feedback, it&#x27;s also important to focus on that which you can take action on.
Getting caught up in the negativity of the feedback will only hinder your ability to improve and grow. You need to learn to take feedback as
a criticism of the work itself rather than of your own abilities. Even if the feedback isn&#x27;t the most tactful, it&#x27;s best to filter it down to
what you need to improve for your own sake.</p>
<p>     Personally, I&#x27;m fairly aware of the fact that I take feedback to heart too much as a criticism of myself. It
can be hard to remember that most people just want to see the product in its best state, so I need to remember not to take it too hard in my
career.</p>

</p><p style="text-align:center">A minimalist workstation</p><p></p>
<p>     <strong>Minimalism</strong> is the key takeaway from this article. There are many adjacent concepts analyzed
and put forward to improve your UI/UX portfolio, but many of them also boil down to minimalism. Good portfolios use simple color schemes,
sleek buttons, and minimal text. These factors help catch the eyes of managers and guide them to the important ares of your portfolio.
Busier portfolios can distract from the work within them.</p>
<p>     This article was an important reminder not to over-design the simple things in this portfolio. By sticking
with minimal flare and a focus on the important elements, I hope to keep this portfolio more digestable for anyone digging into it.</p>

containing a map of the key elements of strong navigation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/nav_concept_map-88e08c422a892283e1e1e785f9b5f27d.jpg" title="Navigation stock image" width="1200" height="1344" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">My Concept Map</p><p></p>
<p>     Above, I&#x27;ve mapped my own hierarchy of important elements to UI navigation.
I consider the navbar to contain the most important elements while body is loosely more important than the
footer. From there, items are listed in order of importance for their sections. I&#x27;ll explain a bit more
of my reasoning below.</p>
<p>     I put search at the top of the hierarchy since many users default to search before
attempting to muddle through any links as mentioned in <em>Don&#x27;t Make Me Think.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-244587" id="user-content-fnref-1-244587-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></em> Not having a good search can alienate a ton of users
who are expecting to use it exclusively. From there, I essentially ordered all the other link types based on how frequently they
should be used and what value they bring to the UI. External links are much lower than the rest because they take users
away from your UI, but they still may be necessary at times. Otherwise, links that lead to larger sections of the UI are
generally ranked higher than one-off pages in my eyes.</p>
<p>     Though navigation is a key part of every UI, it feels like a concept which can fall to the
wayside when getting down into the details of implementing a new feature. This hierarchy will be a helpful guideline in
my career as a reminder of which elements are most important to focus on so as not to forget them when working in other
areas.</p>

to use as inspiration for creating a UI sketch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/inspiration-f1b1e66b05830d9632f0e051c8c9ebc7.jpeg" title="Inspiration stock image" width="7189" height="4798" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>     Inspiration can be a tough thing to find at times. UI design is supposed to involve
artistic expression, so taking inspiration from traditional art may help design something you feel strongly about.
As such, I&#x27;ve went out to find an art piece to take cues from in a UI sketch of my own.</p>
<p>     For this activity, I chose a piece from the Sheldon Art Museum on the University of Nebraska - Lincoln
campus. This piece came from an artist known as Julius Schmidt from Stamford, Connecticut. The piece unfortunately is only labeled
as &quot;Untitled Relief,&quot; but this should be enough to find it for yourself if you&#x27;d like. The piece is a cast iron sculpture with little
notion of any overarching ideas. Rather, it has many cut-outs with all kinds of intricate designs. In the following sections, I&#x27;ll be
analyzing three of my favorite aspects of the piece.</p>
<strong>Labyrinthian</strong>
<p>     While not all sections of the design have open routes to each other, the overall design reminds me of a
labyrinth or maze-like structure. Due to the ties of labyrinths to ancient cultures such as Egypt, Greece, &amp; Crete,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-1-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> this brought me back
to reading books about Greek mythology as a child. I&#x27;ve always found the subject interesting, so attempting to build a UI that ties into
mythology seems like fun. Though labyrinthian design is in some ways antithetical to UI design (UIs should be simple, not eternally confusing),
I think a maze could make for a good logo.</p>
<strong>Archaic</strong>
<p>     This may be a bit of a stretch as the piece was actually created in the 1960s, but I find that it resembles something
you would see at a historic site of an ancient city. As a cast iron piece stored outside, it is now rusty and archaic looking. Again, I&#x27;ve chosen an
aspect that should probably be avoided in UI design since it shouldn&#x27;t feel dated, but I think I can continue to tie this in with the theme of
Greek mythology. Though not often thought about this way due to the lack of printing, fonts were used in many ancient civilizations for consistency in
labeling,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-2-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> so I think using a primitive Greek-esque font in stylized aspects of the page could further connect to the mythology theme.</p>
<strong>Lack of Negative Space</strong>
<p>     In yet another aspect that probably isn&#x27;t suitable for UI design, I quite like the lack of negative space in this
sculpture. Almost everything about it is highly-designed and busy. Despite thinking this is great for a piece that feels like a labyrinth, it
stands out as something I should approach in the opposite manner for a UI design. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a term for what I&#x27;m thinking of as
negative inspiration in this sense, but it leads me to want to keep my composition simple. Negative space is a powerful tool for exactly that.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-3-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>     With those aspects of inspiration laid out, below is my UI sketch for a mobile app catalog of Greek mythology stories and books.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/greek_ui-056ac1c5a9a9fc30e93ad82f1e4a3300.jpg" title="A UI sketch of a mobile catalog for Greek mythology" width="3000" height="3102" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Mobile Mythology Catalog</p><p></p>
<p>     This app would be similar to something like Libby or Kindle where you can search for new works to read, save them to
a reading list, and read the work from directly within the app. Though I tried to make the styling feel ancient Greece themed with headers and icons,
I would keep longer strings of text to a more standard font to make them easier to read. I decided to also go with a maze for the logo to match
the labyrinth inspiration. Had I iterated on this more, I think the maze should have a more distinct pattern to it rather than a generic maze. It fits
the theme less, but I think it would help the logo stick better in the minds of users.</p>
<p>     I&#x27;m not sure if I fully succeeded in using negative space here
since the app seems a little packed, but it&#x27;s hard not to use all the space you&#x27;re given when designing a mobile app. There&#x27;s some amount of space between
cards on the carousels which is probably the most significant use of negative space here.</p>
<p>     In conclusion, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the result of this exercise. I&#x27;ve found that inspiration from traditional sources
can be interpreted in unconventional manners to create something that still follows good design principles. When looking for a place to start on
something new, perhaps an underrated place to look is at something old.</p>

The theme I use can be found here: <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/" target="_blank">Gnome-Look: Nordic Theme</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/UICrop-2bface7b733039280d334e9781773222.png" title="An Ubuntu login screen" width="1108" height="756" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">My VM&#x27;s Login Screen</p><p></p>
<p>     The color scheme used for this theme could possibly be described as analogous since it&#x27;s based on dark blues and blue greens.
However, I think monochrome or perhaps even monotone (with the exception of the blue green highlights) is a better description of the theme depending if you
view these as shades of blue or gray.</p>
<p>     Regardless, these colors are meant to be easy on the eye. I feel that it&#x27;s meant to create a calming mood for something that
you use regularly rather than being a vibrant or eye-catching design. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t interesting as I think the colors here play off of each
other perfectly. More information on the Nord theme can be found <a href="https://github.com/nordtheme/nord" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>     As an exercise, I&#x27;ve attempted to recreate this login screen (minus the mountains in the background as that would be a nightmare) in
three varying color combinations to see the effect this has on the interface&#x27;s mood. Below is the original mockup with the same color scheme.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/mockup-85a1752fa34e8175db098e077ff545af.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Original Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     First is a recreation of this design into something that pops off the screen much more. Instead of the Nord theme, I&#x27;ve went for something
closer to a cyberpunk aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/cyberpunk_mockup-443f9b7aa23e7df98f0ff8e029c9f74e.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with cyberpunk colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Cyberpunk Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This color scheme obviously throws all the subtlety and ease of use out the window. Cyberpunk designs are meant to grab your attention
from anything else due to the vibrant, somewhat clashy colors. I would say this is closest to an adventurous analogous color combination based on the blues
and bright purple/pink with the addition of the yellow which doesn&#x27;t fit that theme. In reality, I&#x27;m not sure it matches any of the harmonious palettes of color theory.
However, someone looking for a futuristic theme that pops may love a more refined version of this theme.</p>
<p>     Next up, I&#x27;ve stuck with the modern/futuristic idea but switched over to a more minimalist palette of red and black.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/redline_mockup-8628e8c6ad690c4e24476cb8ae85172d.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with minimalistic black and red colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Sleek Minimalist Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This scheme returns to something much easier on the eye but in a less subdued way than the original theme. This is meant to feel modern if
not futuristic with the bold red accents. This has none of the natural edge of the orignal. Again, this doesn&#x27;t really fit into one of the harmonious palettes since we&#x27;re
only using one non-neutral color. However, it&#x27;s still a great design for someone who wants some edge in their UI without sacrificing usability or inducing eye strain.</p>
<p>     Lastly, I&#x27;m intentionally picking a harmonious color palette of triads. For this, I&#x27;ve picked the primary colors to aim for something
more childlike.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/childlike_mockup-33c356e2d8b2bc6b3279bb5ab4c19f51.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with childlike colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Childlike Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This final mockup is closer to the cyberpunk aesthetic in the sense that it uses multiple strong colors which fight for your attention. It again
lacks all of the subtlety of the minimalist and original designs, and it definitely has no roots in nature. As I&#x27;ve worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would
expect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on. If for some unholy reason you decide
that your 6-year old needs to learn Linux, this UI is perfect for you. For anyone else, I can&#x27;t really see this being a popular choice.</p>
<p>     To wrap this up, I&#x27;d like to reflect on which of these color palettes I find most effective for a login screen. By effective, I&#x27;m talking about
which one uses colors that play off of each other in the best ways. This would also be the design I expect to be most popular were you to offer it on a theme store.</p>
<p>     I&#x27;m just going to get it out of the way that I think the original theme blows anything I made out of the water. Nord is a well-established
color palette created by talented designers for something perfectly usable. It&#x27;s grounded in nature, and I love dark, calming themes when it comes to something I want to use
every day. They&#x27;ve obviously put much more effort into fine tuning the color choices to make sure everything works together.</p>
<p>     However, if I were to pick the most effective of my own color palettes, I really like how the red and black theme turned out for similar
reasons that I like Nord. It&#x27;s simple and something that I could look at during any time of the day. The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,
but I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night. They&#x27;re too aggressive and bold for something I want to
use regularly. I think the red and black strikes a good balance between ease of use and boldness in the red accents.</p>
<p>     In conclusion, this exercise has helped me better understand how color palettes can completely change the mood of a UI despite none of the
elements changing. This is important to remember as a designer since we always want to make sure we&#x27;re choosing colors intentionally. Color combinations should always
complement the use cases of interfaces instead of just being chosen haphazardly.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/projects/mobile-order">Mobile Order Project</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog">Latest Blog Post</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/jnichols12/jake-ui-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Jake Nichols UI Portfolio.
