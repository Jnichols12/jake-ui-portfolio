This blog post is a reflection of chapters 2-5 of Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think.[^1]*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of Krug's advice seems to revolve around a focus on brevity & conciseness. 
Too many words will bog down a UI & cause the reader to skim too hard leading to them missing the info that's actually important.
Keeping text to a minimum of just the important lines helps catch users' eyes with only what is necessary to digest the page 
& reach their goals. This point feels especially important for me to keep in mind in my career as I often have trouble with 
brevity in general. Even in my personal life, I can't help but over-explain things, so I always send the "essay" texts that everyone hates. 
Knowing when brevity is important is very helpful to me so that I can focus on it to try to counteract my instincts or cut down what 
I've already written.
