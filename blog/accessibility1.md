This blog post is a reflection of chapter 12 of Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think.[^1]*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Everyone</strong> is the key word to remember when it comes to developing
accessibility features. While the first intinct for most of us when asked to think of who will benefit from
accessibility improvements is to imagine some stereotype of a person with a disability, anyone can benefit
form these features. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krug mentions that many resources use the tired example of closed captioning benefiting most
people, but this can be applied in so many other ways. As someone with ever-deteriorating eyesight (i.e. a human),
I find myself squinting more and more at small and even regular text sizes. Customizable font sizes go a long way in
improving a site's accessibility for everyone.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great accessibility feature comes from colorblind filters. While this is a little less of a serious example,
a lot of colorblind features allow users who don't experience colorblindness to customize their experience. One way I see this used is in video 
games where users will use certain colorblind filters to alter the appearance of an effect to their liking or perhaps make the game less aggressive to 
their eyes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless who your main user base is, accessiblity options are always important to keep in mind as a developer
since they can benefit everyone in ways you may never expect.
