            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*The following blog post explains my reasoning based on Eiseman's "The Complete Color Harmony: Pantone Edition"<sup><a href="https://jnichols12.github.io/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2#user-content-fn-1-ccc164" id="user-content-fnref-1-ccc164" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> for choosing purple as the primary color of this portfolio.</p>

</p><p style="text-align:center">In the Simplest Terms: Purple is Stunning</p><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I won't deny that purple being my favorite color plays a large role in the decision to use it here,
there are further reasons why I think it's a good choice for a UI (though to some degree, I'm justifying this for the same reasons it's my favorite color).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find purple unique in the sense that you don't see it used often in more professional settings. It's often relegated to its connotations of royalty, mystique,
or flamboyancy, but I personally agree with the sentiment that purples on the blue end of the spectrum can appear very elegant &amp; dignified. It's eye-catching
but in a subtler sense than a bright orange or deep red. Purple makes a statement without screaming at you to listen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to those who choose to listen is how I like to view my own approach to conversation. I don't take my place in a conversation
by being the loudest but simply by having something to say. Sometimes this may get drowned out by louder voices such as the oranges &amp; reds of the world, but
the reserved thoughts are there for those who choose to listen. Perhaps this has nothing to do with purple, and I'm just projecting my personality onto
my favorite color. Perhaps my personality lead me to choose a color I identify with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps purple has influenced my personality... much like the personality of this portfolio.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="https://jnichols12.github.io/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/presentation_stock-b8059233ce7b2e3dabee2892be754d00.jpeg" title="Example Presentations w/ Good Formatting" width="5477" height="2739" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">An Example of Simple But Effective Slides</p><p></p>
<p>Avoid Bullet-Points (mostly)</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullet-points are often used as a crutch in slide design with most of the words to be spoken, but they should be used sparingly.</li>
<li>You can get away with including much less of what you're going to say on the slides, or you can break up lists into multiple slides with one or two key points each.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay Attention to Eyes</p>
<ul>
<li>When including images of people or animals, make sure the eyes don't lead users away from slide content.</li>
<li>Try to use images where the eyes point at your content, and flip/rearrange images that don't.</li>
</ul>
<p>Break Up Large Quotes (if necessary)</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer quotes can be easier to read in chunks instead of a one large block.</li>
<li>If doing this, break it down into distinct sections on different slides &amp; focus in on the significance of each one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eliminate Noise Around Charts</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure background colors &amp; images don't conflict with the viewer's ability to read a read any elements of charts.</li>
<li>Select simple graph layouts (2D is almost always better than 3D).</li>
<li>Choose colors for graph elements that work well together &amp; don't distract from information.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This blog post is a meta reflection on Ben Shneiderman's paper, "The Eyes Have It: A Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations"<sup><a href="https://jnichols12.github.io/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/shneiderman-analysis#user-content-fn-1-5da721" id="user-content-fnref-1-5da721" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> as well as a reflection on the importance of this paper's concepts in the industry.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="https://jnichols12.github.io/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/tunnel_vision-565df1a7f50d952add711ac357c6eac8.jpeg" title="Tunnel Vision" width="5856" height="3904" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Artistic Depiction of Tunnel Vision</p><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a lot of this paper to be bogged down in implementation details of specific problems/solutions which I don't find terribly helpful when trying to learn a concept.
It's okay to provide examples, but the section on "Overview" for example felt overly-specific. I don't see as much value in talking about specific zoom factors and field-of-view boxes when introducing a concept in a paper like this.
I would've preferred more high-level explanation &amp; justification for the techniques personally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as career importance, the meta point would be to avoid getting caught up in implementation details when having conversations with non-technical stakeholders (or even technical stakeholders in certain cases).
In terms of the actual content of the reading, the principles themselves that were outlined are important to keep in mind while building a UI as they're good guidelines &amp; standards for guiding a user's interaction with your interface.</p>
