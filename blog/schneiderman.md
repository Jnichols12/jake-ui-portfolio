This blog post is a meta reflection on Ben Shneiderman's paper, "The Eyes Have It: A Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations"[^1] as well as a reflection on the importance of this paper's concepts in the industry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a lot of this paper to be bogged down in implementation details of specific problems/solutions which I don't find terribly helpful when trying to learn a concept.
It's okay to provide examples, but the section on "Overview" for example felt overly-specific. I don't see as much value in talking about specific zoom factors and field-of-view boxes when introducing a concept in a paper like this. 
I would've preferred more high-level explanation & justification for the techniques personally.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as career importance, the meta point would be to avoid getting caught up in implementation details when having conversations with non-technical stakeholders (or even technical stakeholders in certain cases).
In terms of the actual content of the reading, the principles themselves that were outlined are important to keep in mind while building a UI as they're good guidelines & standards for guiding a user's interaction with your interface.
