Summit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/language-48f98f0600b5bd7a5a234af87268ce18.jpeg" title="An image of hands holding up the word &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; in various languages" width="6138" height="2444" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>     Recently, I participated in an activity referred to as the UIUN Summit. This was designed
to be a bit of a workshop that was meant to induce negotiations between students about the accessibility needs of certain
populations in a mock redesign of a government website. Each student chose a population for which designers need to meet
certain accessibility standards to properly accommodate. The name UIUN comes from the activity being modeled after a United
Nations meeting in which individuals represent the needs of their country. As someone who originally intended to minor in
Spanish in college, I decided to represent the non-native English-speaking/English as a Second Language (ESL) population.
We first gave brief introductions to our population based on initial research. We then designed presentations covering our
population&#x27;s needs in-depth, and finally, we held negotiations over the most important requirements to make it into a
redesigned local election site.</p>
<p>     Off the bat, I had assumed that vocabulary would be the biggest hurdle for my population.
Having taken four years of Spanish, I was generally able to parse the meaning of a sentence with enough time even if I
didn&#x27;t fully understand the grammar, but vocab isn&#x27;t something you can really intuit unless words are conjugates or there
are enough context clues. Upon further research, this was supported by an article from Bay Atlantic University over the
challenges ESL students face in the classroom.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Unfortunately, this was one of the only strong pieces of research I was able to
find on my population. While there are lots of guidelines and standards for inclusive design regarding populations who
depend on screen readers for example, ESL doesn&#x27;t have the same standards when designing with accessibility in mind.</p>
<p>     For the research of my presentation, I essentially just had to extrapolate from the needs of
ESL students in the classroom as well as from Census data. Though not ideal, I was able to come up with another major need
of non-native English speakers which is clear FAQ and instructions to prevent the need to speak to a live representative.
Speaking and listening were the hardest skills in my Spanish journey, and my research backed up that one of the biggest
struggles for ESL students is finding confidence and motivation to engage with others in English.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> I focused my
requirements around these two points. Additionally, anything that makes the text itself more difficult to parse is an added
barrier to any population, especially those who have trouble comprehending meaning. For this reason, I included a requirement
regarding clear and adjustable fonts. You can read the three requirements for my population in full here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flesch-Kincade testing should be used as a sanity check on all pages to ensure that writing is kept to a reasonable level such as 7th - 8th grade.</li>
<li>All necessary information to vote should be available and clear online to prevent the need to speak to an English-speaking representative.</li>
<li>Adjustable fonts should be available to minimize struggles that aren&#x27;t related to comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p>     After presentations concluded, we met as a group and tried to list, rank, and choose the roughly 4-5
most important requirements which could gain support from multiple populations. Unfortunately, I found this to be the weakest
aspect of the activity. I think we had a pretty non-confrontational group who wasn&#x27;t interested in having heated discussions over
an activity such as this (including myself). For the most part, one person lead the discussions. I don&#x27;t know that anyone fought
too hard over what they wanted, and we didn&#x27;t really mark anything that wasn&#x27;t unanimous or at least that everyone felt indifferent
about. Towards the end, I tried to push the 7th - 8th grade writing level requirement as it had a lot of support from other groups,
but I felt this was mostly shut down on pedantic reasons such as the wording of the requirement as it was listed in our ranking
rather than the requirement itself.</p>
<p>     By the end of negotiations, our requirements became a lot messier as it was suggested by the moderator
that we could pack multiple issues into one &quot;bill&quot; much like the worst aspect of the American political system which prevents nearly
all bipartisan initiatives from passing in Congress, but I digress. Requirements started having unrelated things tacked on in an
attempt to satisfy more populations. I don&#x27;t think this was realistic to the amount of effort necessary to complete each requirement
that got packed together as we were supposed to have a limited budget on priorities. Overall, this derailed the negotation aspect and
diminished the quality of the exercise in my opinion.</p>
<p>     One thing that surprised me about negotiations was the amount of overlap my requirements had with
the population of people with Dyslexia. In hindsight, this makes sense as both populations primarily struggle with language and
comprehension. Additionally, children under 13 were a strong ally, but I did predict this since children are also generally at
a point where they are still learning English and how to fully comprehend it. We also unfortunately didn&#x27;t have a representative
present for a population reliant on screen readers. However, one student chose to play that part briefly which threw a wrench
in things. Though in a real project, you would absolutely develop for screen readers from the start, we had neglected this until
the end and basically had to convince them that we couldn&#x27;t afford that anymore. Feeling forced to deny a major requirement for
such a large portion of web users wasn&#x27;t a great feeling. However, I think this came down more to the structure of the activity
and the order in which we proceeded rather than a realistic representation of design.</p>
<p>     Ultimately, the summit was an interesting (albeit flawed) exercise in inclusive design. While it got
me thinking more about the importance of designing for populations with accessibility needs, I think it would&#x27;ve been more productive
without some of the strange constraints around the negotiations and a more involved group. If there&#x27;s one takeaway I can pull from this,
it&#x27;s that if put in a situation like this in industry, I realize now that you have to fight for a population&#x27;s needs if you want them
to make it into an already packed backlog.</p>

to use as inspiration for creating a UI sketch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/inspiration-f1b1e66b05830d9632f0e051c8c9ebc7.jpeg" title="Inspiration stock image" width="7189" height="4798" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>     Inspiration can be a tough thing to find at times. UI design is supposed to involve
artistic expression, so taking inspiration from traditional art may help design something you feel strongly about.
As such, I&#x27;ve went out to find an art piece to take cues from in a UI sketch of my own.</p>
<p>     For this activity, I chose a piece from the Sheldon Art Museum on the University of Nebraska - Lincoln
campus. This piece came from an artist known as Julius Schmidt from Stamford, Connecticut. The piece unfortunately is only labeled
as &quot;Untitled Relief,&quot; but this should be enough to find it for yourself if you&#x27;d like. The piece is a cast iron sculpture with little
notion of any overarching ideas. Rather, it has many cut-outs with all kinds of intricate designs. In the following sections, I&#x27;ll be
analyzing three of my favorite aspects of the piece.</p>
<strong>Labyrinthian</strong>
<p>      While not all sections of the design have open routes to each other, the overall design reminds me of a
labyrinth or maze-like structure. Due to the ties of labyrinths to ancient cultures such as Egypt, Greece, &amp; Crete,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-1-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> this brought me back
to reading books about Greek mythology as a child. I&#x27;ve always found the subject interesting, so attempting to build a UI that ties into
mythology seems like fun. Though labyrinthian design is in some ways antithetical to UI design (UIs should be simple, not eternally confusing),
I think a maze could make for a good logo.</p>
<strong>Archaic</strong>
<p>     This may be a bit of a stretch as the piece was actually created in the 1960s, but I find that it resembles something
you would see at a historic site of an ancient city. As a cast iron piece stored outside, it is now rusty and archaic looking. Again, I&#x27;ve chosen an
aspect that should probably be avoided in UI design since it shouldn&#x27;t feel dated, but I think I can continue to tie this in with the theme of
Greek mythology. Though not often thought about this way due to the lack of printing, fonts were used in many ancient civilizations for consistency in
labeling,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-2-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> so I think using a primitive Greek-esque font in stylized aspects of the page could further connect to the mythology theme.</p>
<strong>Lack of Negative Space</strong>
<p>     In yet another aspect that probably isn&#x27;t suitable for UI design, I quite like the lack of negative space in this
sculpture. Almost everything about it is highly-designed and busy. Despite thinking this is great for a piece that feels like a labyrinth, it
stands out as something I should approach in the opposite manner for a UI design. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a term for what I&#x27;m thinking of as
negative inspiration in this sense, but it leads me to want to keep my composition simple. Negative space is a powerful tool for exactly that.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3-a54404" id="user-content-fnref-3-a54404" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>     With those aspects of inspiration laid out, below is my UI sketch for a mobile app catalog of Greek mythology stories and books.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/greek_ui-056ac1c5a9a9fc30e93ad82f1e4a3300.jpg" title="A UI sketch of a mobile catalog for Greek mythology" width="3000" height="3102" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Mobile Mythology Catalog</p><p></p>
<p>     This app would be similar to something like Libby or Kindle where you can search for new works to read, save them to
a reading list, and read the work from directly within the app. Though I tried to make the styling feel ancient Greece themed with headers and icons,
I would keep longer strings of text to a more standard font to make them easier to read. I decided to also go with a maze for the logo to match
the labyrinth inspiration. Had I iterated on this more, I think the maze should have a more distinct pattern to it rather than a generic maze. It fits
the theme less, but I think it would help the logo stick better in the minds of users.</p>
<p>     I&#x27;m not sure if I fully succeeded in using negative space here
since the app seems a little packed, but it&#x27;s hard not to use all the space you&#x27;re given when designing a mobile app. There&#x27;s some amount of space between
cards on the carousels which is probably the most significant use of negative space here.</p>
<p>     In conclusion, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the result of this exercise. I&#x27;ve found that inspiration from traditional sources
can be interpreted in unconventional manners to create something that still follows good design principles. When looking for a place to start on
something new, perhaps an underrated place to look is at something old.</p>

The theme I use can be found here: <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/" target="_blank">Gnome-Look: Nordic Theme</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/UICrop-2bface7b733039280d334e9781773222.png" title="An Ubuntu login screen" width="1108" height="756" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">My VM&#x27;s Login Screen</p><p></p>
<p>     The color scheme used for this theme could possibly be described as analogous since it&#x27;s based on dark blues and blue greens.
However, I think monochrome or perhaps even monotone (with the exception of the blue green highlights) is a better description of the theme depending if you
view these as shades of blue or gray.</p>
<p>     Regardless, these colors are meant to be easy on the eye. I feel that it&#x27;s meant to create a calming mood for something that
you use regularly rather than being a vibrant or eye-catching design. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t interesting as I think the colors here play off of each
other perfectly. More information on the Nord theme can be found <a href="https://github.com/nordtheme/nord" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>     As an exercise, I&#x27;ve attempted to recreate this login screen (minus the mountains in the background as that would be a nightmare) in
three varying color combinations to see the effect this has on the interface&#x27;s mood. Below is the original mockup with the same color scheme.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/mockup-85a1752fa34e8175db098e077ff545af.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Original Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     First is a recreation of this design into something that pops off the screen much more. Instead of the Nord theme, I&#x27;ve went for something
closer to a cyberpunk aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/cyberpunk_mockup-443f9b7aa23e7df98f0ff8e029c9f74e.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with cyberpunk colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Cyberpunk Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This color scheme obviously throws all the subtlety and ease of use out the window. Cyberpunk designs are meant to grab your attention
from anything else due to the vibrant, somewhat clashy colors. I would say this is closest to an adventurous analogous color combination based on the blues
and bright purple/pink with the addition of the yellow which doesn&#x27;t fit that theme. In reality, I&#x27;m not sure it matches any of the harmonious palettes of color theory.
However, someone looking for a futuristic theme that pops may love a more refined version of this theme.</p>
<p>     Next up, I&#x27;ve stuck with the modern/futuristic idea but switched over to a more minimalist palette of red and black.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/redline_mockup-8628e8c6ad690c4e24476cb8ae85172d.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with minimalistic black and red colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Sleek Minimalist Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This scheme returns to something much easier on the eye but in a less subdued way than the original theme. This is meant to feel modern if
not futuristic with the bold red accents. This has none of the natural edge of the orignal. Again, this doesn&#x27;t really fit into one of the harmonious palettes since we&#x27;re
only using one non-neutral color. However, it&#x27;s still a great design for someone who wants some edge in their UI without sacrificing usability or inducing eye strain.</p>
<p>     Lastly, I&#x27;m intentionally picking a harmonious color palette of triads. For this, I&#x27;ve picked the primary colors to aim for something
more childlike.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/childlike_mockup-33c356e2d8b2bc6b3279bb5ab4c19f51.png" title="A recreated Ubuntu login screen with childlike colors" width="1035" height="576" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">Childlike Mockup</p><p></p>
<p>     This final mockup is closer to the cyberpunk aesthetic in the sense that it uses multiple strong colors which fight for your attention. It again
lacks all of the subtlety of the minimalist and original designs, and it definitely has no roots in nature. As I&#x27;ve worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would
expect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on. If for some unholy reason you decide
that your 6-year old needs to learn Linux, this UI is perfect for you. For anyone else, I can&#x27;t really see this being a popular choice.</p>
<p>     To wrap this up, I&#x27;d like to reflect on which of these color palettes I find most effective for a login screen. By effective, I&#x27;m talking about
which one uses colors that play off of each other in the best ways. This would also be the design I expect to be most popular were you to offer it on a theme store.</p>
<p>     I&#x27;m just going to get it out of the way that I think the original theme blows anything I made out of the water. Nord is a well-established
color palette created by talented designers for something perfectly usable. It&#x27;s grounded in nature, and I love dark, calming themes when it comes to something I want to use
every day. They&#x27;ve obviously put much more effort into fine tuning the color choices to make sure everything works together.</p>
<p>     However, if I were to pick the most effective of my own color palettes, I really like how the red and black theme turned out for similar
reasons that I like Nord. It&#x27;s simple and something that I could look at during any time of the day. The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,
but I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night. They&#x27;re too aggressive and bold for something I want to
use regularly. I think the red and black strikes a good balance between ease of use and boldness in the red accents.</p>
<p>     In conclusion, this exercise has helped me better understand how color palettes can completely change the mood of a UI despite none of the
elements changing. This is important to remember as a designer since we always want to make sure we&#x27;re choosing colors intentionally. Color combinations should always
complement the use cases of interfaces instead of just being chosen haphazardly.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/jake-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2">Why Did I Choose Purple For My Portfolio?</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-25T18:50:00.000Z">September 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/jnichols12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/img/jake_profile.jpg" alt="Jake Nichols"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/jnichols12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Jake Nichols</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Student">Student</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The following blog post explains my reasoning based on Eiseman&#x27;s <em>The Complete Color Harmony<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-ccc164" id="user-content-fnref-1-ccc164" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></em> for choosing purple as the primary color of this portfolio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/purple-be7f6d2de53bf8057d7b122c004b7674.jpeg" title="A sunset over a purple sky" width="5000" height="3333" class="img_ev3q">
</p><p style="text-align:center">In the Simplest Terms: Purple is Stunning</p><p></p>
<p>     While I won&#x27;t deny that purple being my favorite color plays a large role in the decision to use it here,
there are further reasons why I think it&#x27;s a good choice for a UI (though to some degree, I&#x27;m justifying this for the same reasons it&#x27;s my favorite color).</p>
<p>     I find purple unique in the sense that you don&#x27;t see it used often in more professional settings. It&#x27;s often relegated to its connotations of royalty, mystique,
or flamboyancy, but I personally agree with the sentiment that purples on the blue end of the spectrum can appear very elegant &amp; dignified. It&#x27;s eye-catching
but in a subtler sense than a bright orange or deep red. Purple makes a statement without screaming at you to listen.</p>
<p>     Speaking to those who choose to listen is how I like to view my own approach to conversation. I don&#x27;t take my place in a conversation
by being the loudest but simply by having something to say. Sometimes this may get drowned out by louder voices such as the oranges &amp; reds of the world, but
the reserved thoughts are there for those who choose to listen. Perhaps this has nothing to do with purple, and I&#x27;m just projecting my personality onto
my favorite color. Perhaps my personality lead me to choose a color I identify with.</p>
<p>     Or, perhaps purple has influenced my personality... much like the personality of this portfolio.</p>
