&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Minimalism</strong> is the key takeaway from this article. There are many adjacent concepts analyzed
and put forward to improve your UI/UX portfolio, but many of them also boil down to minimalism. Good portfolios use simple color schemes,
sleek buttons, and minimal text. These factors help catch the eyes of managers and guide them to the important ares of your portfolio.
Busier portfolios can distract from the work within them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article was an important reminder not to over-design the simple things in this portfolio. By sticking
with minimal flare and a focus on the important elements, I hope to keep this portfolio more digestable for anyone digging into it.
