called the UIUN Summit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="/jake-ui-portfolio/assets/images/language-48f98f0600b5bd7a5a234af87268ce18.jpeg" title="An image of hands holding up the word &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; in various languages" width="6138" height="2444" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>     Recently, I participated in an activity referred to as the UIUN Summit. This was designed
to be a bit of a workshop that was meant to induce negotiations between students about the accessibility needs of certain
populations in a mock redesign of a government website. Each student chose a population for which designers need to meet
certain accessibility standards to properly accommodate. The name UIUN comes from the activity being modeled after a United
Nations meeting in which individuals represent the needs of their country. As someone who originally intended to minor in
Spanish in college, I decided to represent the non-native English-speaking/English as a Second Language (ESL) population.
We first gave brief introductions to our population based on initial research. We then designed presentations covering our
population&#x27;s needs in-depth, and finally, we held negotiations over the most important requirements to make it into a
redesigned local election site.</p>
<p>     Off the bat, I had assumed that vocabulary would be the biggest hurdle for my population.
Having taken four years of Spanish, I was generally able to parse the meaning of a sentence with enough time even if I
didn&#x27;t fully understand the grammar, but vocab isn&#x27;t something you can really intuit unless words are conjugates or there
are enough context clues. Upon further research, this was supported by an article from Bay Atlantic University over the
challenges ESL students face in the classroom.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Unfortunately, this was one of the only strong pieces of research I was able to
find on my population. While there are lots of guidelines and standards for inclusive design regarding populations who
depend on screen readers for example, ESL doesn&#x27;t have the same standards when designing with accessibility in mind.</p>
<p>     For the research of my presentation, I essentially just had to extrapolate from the needs of
ESL students in the classroom as well as from Census data. Though not ideal, I was able to come up with another major need
of non-native English speakers which is clear FAQ and instructions to prevent the need to speak to a live representative.
Speaking and listening were the hardest skills in my Spanish journey, and my research backed up that one of the biggest
struggles for ESL students is finding confidence and motivation to engage with others in English.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-6559ab" id="user-content-fnref-1-6559ab-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> I focused my
requirements around these two points. Additionally, anything that makes the text itself more difficult to parse is an added
barrier to any population, especially those who have trouble comprehending meaning. For this reason, I included a requirement
regarding clear and adjustable fonts. You can read the three requirements for my population in full here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flesch-Kincade testing should be used as a sanity check on all pages to ensure that writing is kept to a reasonable level such as 7th - 8th grade.</li>
<li>All necessary information to vote should be available and clear online to prevent the need to speak to an English-speaking representative.</li>
<li>Adjustable fonts should be available to minimize struggles that aren&#x27;t related to comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p>     After presentations concluded, we met as a group and tried to list, rank, and choose the roughly 4-5
most important requirements which could gain support from multiple populations. Unfortunately, I found this to be the weakest
aspect of the activity. I think we had a pretty non-confrontational group who wasn&#x27;t interested in having heated discussions over
an activity such as this (including myself). For the most part, one person lead the discussions. I don&#x27;t know that anyone fought
too hard over what they wanted, and we didn&#x27;t really mark anything that wasn&#x27;t unanimous or at least that everyone felt indifferent
about. Towards the end, I tried to push the 7th - 8th grade writing level requirement as it had a lot of support from other groups,
but I felt this was mostly shut down on pedantic reasons such as the wording of the requirement as it was listed in our ranking
rather than the requirement itself.</p>
<p>     By the end of negotiations, our requirements became a lot messier as it was suggested by the moderator
that we could pack multiple issues into one &quot;bill&quot; much like the worst aspect of the American political system which prevents nearly
all bipartisan initiatives from passing in Congress, but I digress. Requirements started having unrelated things tacked on in an
attempt to satisfy more populations. I don&#x27;t think this was realistic to the amount of effort necessary to complete each requirement
that got packed together as we were supposed to have a limited budget on priorities. Overall, this derailed the negotation aspect and
diminished the quality of the exercise in my opinion.</p>
<p>     One thing that surprised me about negotiations was the amount of overlap my requirements had with
the population of people with Dyslexia. In hindsight, this makes sense as both populations primarily struggle with language and
comprehension. Additionally, children under 13 were a strong ally, but I did predict this since children are also generally at
a point where they are still learning English and how to fully comprehend it. We also unfortunately didn&#x27;t have a representative
present for a population reliant on screen readers. However, one student chose to play that part briefly which threw a wrench
in things. Though in a real project, you would absolutely develop for screen readers from the start, we had neglected this until
the end and basically had to convince them that we couldn&#x27;t afford that anymore. Feeling forced to deny a major requirement for
such a large portion of web users wasn&#x27;t a great feeling. However, I think this came down more to the structure of the activity
and the order in which we proceeded rather than a realistic representation of design.</p>
<p>     Ultimately, the summit was an interesting (albeit flawed) exercise in inclusive design. While it got
me thinking more about the importance of designing for populations with accessibility needs, I think it would&#x27;ve been more productive
without some of the strange constraints around the negotiations and a more involved group. If there&#x27;s one takeaway I can pull from this,
it&#x27;s that if put in a situation like this in industry, I realize now that you have to fight for a population&#x27;s needs if you want them
to make it into an already packed backlog.</p>
