The following blog post explains my reasoning based on Eiseman's *The Complete Color Harmony[^1]* for choosing purple as the primary color of this portfolio.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I won't deny that purple being my favorite color plays a large role in the decision to use it here,
there are further reasons why I think it's a good choice for a UI (though to some degree, I'm justifying this for the same reasons it's my favorite color).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find purple unique in the sense that you don't see it used often in more professional settings. It's often relegated to its connotations of royalty, mystique,
or flamboyancy, but I personally agree with the sentiment that purples on the blue end of the spectrum can appear very elegant & dignified. It's eye-catching
but in a subtler sense than a bright orange or deep red. Purple makes a statement without screaming at you to listen.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to those who choose to listen is how I like to view my own approach to conversation. I don't take my place in a conversation
by being the loudest but simply by having something to say. Sometimes this may get drowned out by louder voices such as the oranges & reds of the world, but
the reserved thoughts are there for those who choose to listen. Perhaps this has nothing to do with purple, and I'm just projecting my personality onto
my favorite color. Perhaps my personality lead me to choose a color I identify with. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps purple has influenced my personality... much like the personality of this portfolio.
