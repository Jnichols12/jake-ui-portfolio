This blog post contains a few recreations of a login screen for one of my Ubuntu virtual machines. 
The theme I use can be found here: <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/" target="_blank">Gnome-Look: Nordic Theme</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color scheme used for this theme could possibly be described as analogous since it's based on dark blues and blue greens.
However, I think monochrome or perhaps even monotone (with the exception of the blue green highlights) is a better description of the theme depending if you 
view these as shades of blue or gray.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, these colors are meant to be easy on the eye. I feel that it's meant to create a calming mood for something that
you use regularly rather than being a vibrant or eye-catching design. That's not to say it isn't interesting as I think the colors here play off of each
other perfectly. More information on the Nord theme can be found <a href="https://github.com/nordtheme/nord" target="_blank">here</a>.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an exercise, I've attempted to recreate this login screen (minus the mountains in the background as that would be a nightmare) in
three varying color combinations to see the effect this has on the interface's mood. Below is the original mockup with the same color scheme.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is a recreation of this design into something that pops off the screen much more. Instead of the Nord theme, I've went for something
closer to a cyberpunk aesthetic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This color scheme obviously throws all the subtlety and ease of use out the window. Cyberpunk designs are meant to grab your attention
from anything else due to the vibrant, somewhat clashy colors. I would say this is closest to an adventurous analogous color combination based on the blues
and bright purple/pink with the addition of the yellow which doesn't fit that theme. In reality, I'm not sure it matches any of the harmonious palettes of color theory.
However, someone looking for a futuristic theme that pops may love a more refined version of this theme.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up, I've stuck with the modern/futuristic idea but switched over to a more minimalist palette of red and black.

<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Sleek Minimalist Mockup</p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme returns to something much easier on the eye but in a less subdued way than the original theme. This is meant to feel modern if
not futuristic with the bold red accents. This has none of the natural edge of the orignal. Again, this doesn't really fit into one of the harmonious palettes since we're
only using one non-neutral color. However, it's still a great design for someone who wants some edge in their UI without sacrificing usability or inducing eye strain.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I'm intentionally picking a harmonious color palette of triads. For this, I've picked the primary colors to aim for something
more childlike.

<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Childlike Mockup</p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This final mockup is closer to the cyberpunk aesthetic in the sense that it uses multiple strong colors which fight for your attention. It again
lacks all of the subtlety of the minimalist and original designs, and it definitely has no roots in nature. As I've worded it already, it comes off as childlike as you would
expect to see these colors on toys or one of those tables/rugs with a top-down view of a city that kids love to play on. If for some unholy reason you decide
that your 6-year old needs to learn Linux, this UI is perfect for you. For anyone else, I can't really see this being a popular choice.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap this up, I'd like to reflect on which of these color palettes I find most effective for a login screen. By effective, I'm talking about
which one uses colors that play off of each other in the best ways. This would also be the design I expect to be most popular were you to offer it on a theme store.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just going to get it out of the way that I think the original theme blows anything I made out of the water. Nord is a well-established 
color palette created by talented designers for something perfectly usable. It's grounded in nature, and I love dark, calming themes when it comes to something I want to use 
every day. They've obviously put much more effort into fine tuning the color choices to make sure everything works together. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I were to pick the most effective of my own color palettes, I really like how the red and black theme turned out for similar 
reasons that I like Nord. It's simple and something that I could look at during any time of the day. The cyberpunk and childlike aesthetics have their use cases as well,
but I feel that they would be too much for me if I were coming to my PC early in the morning or late at night. They're too aggressive and bold for something I want to
use regularly. I think the red and black strikes a good balance between ease of use and boldness in the red accents.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this exercise has helped me better understand how color palettes can completely change the mood of a UI despite none of the
elements changing. This is important to remember as a designer since we always want to make sure we're choosing colors intentionally. Color combinations should always
complement the use cases of interfaces instead of just being chosen haphazardly.
