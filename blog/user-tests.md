This blog post is a reflection of chapters 8 & 9 of Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think.[^1]*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Space</strong> is necessary for your participants to provide good feedback
during a user test. It's always tempting for me to ask railroading and leading questions. I tend to ask users and stakeholders
which of two options they prefer rather than finding out what they want. However, giving the space necessary to give
feedback on what a user actually wants or dislikes will lead to much more productive user testing. It's important
to ask more general questions that allow users to explore and express their own thoughts. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lesson that's useful in many aspects of a software development career. While
we're applying it here to UI and usability, leaving space for feedback and organic responses can also be extremely
helpful in requirements elicitation or just general discussions with coworkers.
