This blog post covers an exercise I performed in which I found an art piece from a museum
to use as inspiration for creating a UI sketch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiration can be a tough thing to find at times. UI design is supposed to involve
artistic expression, so taking inspiration from traditional art may help design something you feel strongly about.
As such, I've went out to find an art piece to take cues from in a UI sketch of my own.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this activity, I chose a piece from the Sheldon Art Museum on the University of Nebraska - Lincoln
campus. This piece came from an artist known as Julius Schmidt from Stamford, Connecticut. The piece unfortunately is only labeled
as "Untitled Relief," but this should be enough to find it for yourself if you'd like. The piece is a cast iron sculpture with little
notion of any overarching ideas. Rather, it has many cut-outs with all kinds of intricate designs. In the following sections, I'll be 
analyzing three of my favorite aspects of the piece.


<strong>Labyrinthian</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not all sections of the design have open routes to each other, the overall design reminds me of a
labyrinth or maze-like structure. Due to the ties of labyrinths to ancient cultures such as Egypt, Greece, & Crete,[^1] this brought me back
to reading books about Greek mythology as a child. I've always found the subject interesting, so attempting to build a UI that ties into
mythology seems like fun. Though labyrinthian design is in some ways antithetical to UI design (UIs should be simple, not eternally confusing),
I think a maze could make for a good logo.


<strong>Archaic</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a stretch as the piece was actually created in the 1960s, but I find that it resembles something
you would see at a historic site of an ancient city. As a cast iron piece stored outside, it is now rusty and archaic looking. Again, I've chosen an
aspect that should probably be avoided in UI design since it shouldn't feel dated, but I think I can continue to tie this in with the theme of
Greek mythology. Though not often thought about this way due to the lack of printing, fonts were used in many ancient civilizations for consistency in 
labeling,[^2] so I think using a primitive Greek-esque font in stylized aspects of the page could further connect to the mythology theme.


<strong>Lack of Negative Space</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yet another aspect that probably isn't suitable for UI design, I quite like the lack of negative space in this
sculpture. Almost everything about it is highly-designed and busy. Despite thinking this is great for a piece that feels like a labyrinth, it
stands out as something I should approach in the opposite manner for a UI design. I'm not sure if there's a term for what I'm thinking of as
negative inspiration in this sense, but it leads me to want to keep my composition simple. Negative space is a powerful tool for exactly that.[^3]


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those aspects of inspiration laid out, below is my UI sketch for a mobile app catalog of Greek mythology stories and books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This app would be similar to something like Libby or Kindle where you can search for new works to read, save them to
a reading list, and read the work from directly within the app. Though I tried to make the styling feel ancient Greece themed with headers and icons,
I would keep longer strings of text to a more standard font to make them easier to read. I decided to also go with a maze for the logo to match
the labyrinth inspiration. Had I iterated on this more, I think the maze should have a more distinct pattern to it rather than a generic maze. It fits
the theme less, but I think it would help the logo stick better in the minds of users. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if I fully succeeded in using negative space here
since the app seems a little packed, but it's hard not to use all the space you're given when designing a mobile app. There's some amount of space between
cards on the carousels which is probably the most significant use of negative space here.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I'm pretty satisfied with the result of this exercise. I've found that inspiration from traditional sources
can be interpreted in unconventional manners to create something that still follows good design principles. When looking for a place to start on 
something new, perhaps an underrated place to look is at something old.
