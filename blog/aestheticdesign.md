Avoid Bullet-Points (mostly)

    + Bullet-points are often used as a crutch in slide design with most of the words to be spoken, but they should be used sparingly.
    + You can get away with including much less of what you're going to say on the slides, or you can break up lists into multiple slides with one or two key points each.


Pay Attention to Eyes

    + When including images of people or animals, make sure the eyes don't lead users away from slide content.
    + Try to use images where the eyes point at your content, and flip/rearrange images that don't.


Break Up Large Quotes (if necessary)

    + Longer quotes can be easier to read in chunks instead of a one large block.
    + If doing this, break it down into distinct sections on different slides & focus in on the significance of each one.


Eliminate Noise Around Charts

    + Make sure background colors & images don't conflict with the viewer's ability to read a read any elements of charts.
    + Select simple graph layouts (2D is almost always better than 3D).
    + Choose colors for graph elements that work well together & don't distract from information.
