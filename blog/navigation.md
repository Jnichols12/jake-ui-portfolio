This blog post is a reflection of chapter 6 of Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think[^1]* 
containing a map of the key elements of strong navigation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, I've mapped my own hierarchy of important elements to UI navigation.
I consider the navbar to contain the most important elements while body is loosely more important than the
footer. From there, items are listed in order of importance for their sections. I'll explain a bit more
of my reasoning below.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put search at the top of the hierarchy since many users default to search before
attempting to muddle through any links as mentioned in *Don't Make Me Think.[^1]* Not having a good search can alienate a ton of users
who are expecting to use it exclusively. From there, I essentially ordered all the other link types based on how frequently they
should be used and what value they bring to the UI. External links are much lower than the rest because they take users 
away from your UI, but they still may be necessary at times. Otherwise, links that lead to larger sections of the UI are
generally ranked higher than one-off pages in my eyes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though navigation is a key part of every UI, it feels like a concept which can fall to the
wayside when getting down into the details of implementing a new feature. This hierarchy will be a helpful guideline in 
my career as a reminder of which elements are most important to focus on so as not to forget them when working in other
areas.
