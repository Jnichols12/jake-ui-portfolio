&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Focus</strong> is the word that stands out to me from the article. Both giving & receiving feedback
are based heavily on where you place your focus. When giving negative feedback, it's important to focus on what's wrong and what can be 
improved rather than broad statements about quality or shortcomings of the designer. Giving direct, actionable feedback on how to improve
the product helps prevent the developer from feeling like the feedback is a criticism of themself.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a designer receiving negative feedback, it's also important to focus on that which you can take action on.
Getting caught up in the negativity of the feedback will only hinder your ability to improve and grow. You need to learn to take feedback as
a criticism of the work itself rather than of your own abilities. Even if the feedback isn't the most tactful, it's best to filter it down to
what you need to improve for your own sake.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I'm fairly aware of the fact that I take feedback to heart too much as a criticism of myself. It
can be hard to remember that most people just want to see the product in its best state, so I need to remember not to take it too hard in my
career.
