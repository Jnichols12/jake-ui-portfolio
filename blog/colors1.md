The following post reflects on Eiseman's *The Complete Color Harmony[^1]* as it relates to color theory and the role of color in design as compared to spice in cooking.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sense that no dish is complete without spice, no interface is complete without color. Sure, some people cook with
little more than salt in the same way that some websites use simple black text on white backgrounds. Though there may be a time and place for this type of
design (Wikipedia comes to mind, but even they use some amount of color), most interfaces would be horribly boring without a good color scheme. In the same
way, salt may be all you need when cooking for picky eaters or just making something edible, but the dish will never reach the same heights it would with
a full flavor profile of spices.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color doesn't often define an interface, but it's an almost necessary component to create something that will stick with users
after they stop interacting with your interface due to the emotional significance of color. Like spice, it's also important to pick the correct color combinations. 
Throwing everything & the kitchen sink into a dish or design is a good way to overwhelm users and create something with no identity. Color palettes are often created 
from three colors which play off of each other in one way or another just like a recipe often calls for a handful of complementary spices.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color's importance and necessitation of both restraint and combination are important to remember for anyone going into UI design
or really any career that relates to interfaces. Without understanding these concepts, you're bound to go too far to one end of the spectrum. Understanding
how to use smart color combinations and experiment to create your own unique themes will elevate everything from new UIs to simple updates of existing ones.
